FOREWORD
The Institute is especially grateful to our outstanding Seminar Chairperson, Gerald L.
Blanchard, for providing the necessary leadership, organization and supervision that
has brought this program into a reality. Indeed a debt of gratitude is particularly due
our articulate and knowledgeable faculty without whose untiring efforts and dedication
in the preparation of papers and in appearing on the program as speakers, this program
would not have been possible. Their names are listed on the program at page iv of this
book and their contributions to the success of this seminar are immeasurable.
I would be remiss if I did not extend a special thanks to each of you who are attending
this seminar and for whom the program was planned. All of us hope your attendance
will be most beneficial as well as enjoyable. Your comments and suggestions are always
welcome.

February, 2012

Excerpts from
The Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010: An Annotated Guide
by Knox Dobbins and Jason Stone
North Law Publishers, Inc. (http://www.northlawpublishers.com)

Sec. 1002.

DEFINITIONS.

Except as otherwise provided in this title, for purposes of this title, the following definitions shall
apply:
* * * *
(13) Fair lending.-- The term "fair lending" means fair, equitable, and nondiscriminatory
access to credit for consumers.
* * * *
CROSS-REFERENCES
* * * *
(13) Fair Lending
Office of Fair Lending and Equal Opportunity, see § 1013(c).
Consumer Advisory Board, see § 1014.
Required reports to Congress, see § 1016.
Joint investigations of Bureau, HUD and/or Attorney General, see § 1052(a)(2).
Report regarding private education loans and private education lenders, see § 1077.

* * * *
COMMENTARY
* * * *
Perhaps the most significant definitional shift from existing federal consumer law lies in the
definition of “fair lending” in Section 1002(13). That subsection provides: “The term ‘fair lending’ means
fair, equitable, and nondiscriminatory access to credit for consumers.”

Chapter 1
2 of 105

Under current laws, particularly the Fair Housing Act and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act,1 the fair
lending focus lies on eliminating affirmative discrimination by lenders acting on a prohibited basis. Disparate
treatment or impact, as well as overt discrimination, are prohibited, but they must be based on a personal
characteristic of a consumer or service applicant.2 Subsection 1002(13) seemingly addresses more.
First, the requirement of “fair” and “equitable” is not tied to unfairness occurring on the basis of bias
tied to race, gender, color, religion or national origin. For instance, unfair pricing – charging any consumer,
regardless of his demographic, more for one product than for a comparable product – would seem under the
Section 1002(13) definition to be unfair lending.
Perhaps more importantly, including “access” in the definition of “fair lending” seems to extend the
concept and requirement beyond fair dealing with a covered person’s customers and applicants. To require
that consumers upon application not be denied nondiscriminatory credit, which is the principle underlying
current fair lending laws, is a much lesser requirement than mandating that consumers have access to “fair”
(however defined) credit.
The Act may not provide the Bureau with the authority to make rules based on this definitional shift
in the concept of “fair lending.” The new “fair lending” definition in Section 1002 applies only to the term
as used in this Act itself. It does not amend ECOA or other federal statutes addressing fair lending or the
definitions in those other statutes.

Section 1031, which sets out the goals of Bureau rulemaking, and Section 1036, which lays out
prohibitions, only address “acts or practices” or the offering or provision of products. They do not reach to
the absence of credit access or credit transactions by a covered person. Subsection (c) of Section 1031,
moreover, imposes a high hurdle for the Bureau to declare an act or practice “unfair.”3
Yet Section 1052 authorizes the Bureau to join Justice or HUD with subpoenas, CIDs and required
testimony in investigating “matters relating to fair lending.”4 It is not clear whether this authority can or will
be used to implement the new definition of “fair lending” outside an allegation of a violation of existing
federal consumer statutes, with their more limited definition of “fair lending.”

Disparate impact claims on the way out under the Fair Housing Act
Christopher Willis
Partner and Chair of the Fair Lending Task Force
Ballard Spahr LLP, Atlanta
In late February, the Supreme Court will hear argument on a case of
extraordinary importance to the housing and mortgage lending industries.
Magner v. Gallagher will allow the Court to decide whether "disparate impact"
claims can be brought under the Fair Housing Act, and I believe that the Court
will say "no." The reason is simple: the plain language of the statute does not
provide for such claims.
By way of background, there are several federal statutes that prohibit
discrimination in various contexts, like Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964
and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act ("ADEA"). Some provisions of
those statutes make it illegal to engage in intentional discrimination against
someone because of their race, gender or age. This is called "disparate
treatment." But other provisions of those statutes also prohibit disparate impact
discrimination. This refers to a practice that may have been undertaken with no
discriminatory intent, but which impacts people in a disproportionate way
because of race or some other protected status.
The difference between the two types of provisions carries enormous
importance. It's one thing for companies to understand that they cannot engage
in intentional discrimination, but avoiding disparate impact claims is much
harder, because it requires complex statistical analysis to determine whether
such an impact exists, and if so, why.
The starting point -- and I believe ending point -- of the Supreme Court's
analysis in Magner will be the language of the Fair Housing Act itself, and
particularly section 804(a) of the Act. That section provides that it is a violation
of the Act "[t]o refuse to sell or rent after the making of a bona fide offer, or to
refuse to negotiate for the sale or rental of, or otherwise make unavailable or
deny, a dwelling to any person because of race, color, religion, sex, familial status,
or national origin."
The language requires an intentional act of discrimination, because it uses
a series of active words to denote the discriminatory conduct it prohibits -refusing to sell or rent a dwelling, and refusing to negotiate a sale or rental. Even
the catch-all language -- to "otherwise make available or deny" a dwelling -speaks to an intentional act of denying housing "because of" a protected
characteristic.
But since the Supreme Court has already considered disparate impact
claims under other federal statutes, we need to look at the language that the
Court found to create such claims. In doing that, we need to bear in mind that

Chapter 1
104 of 105

both Title VII and the ADEA have two relevant provisions. Since they are similar
to each other, I use the Title VII language for this discussion.
The first provision in Title VII, section 703(a)(1), prohibits the following:
"to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to
discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms,
conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual’s race, color,
religion, sex, or national origin." This provision uses a series of active words: to
fail or refuse to hire, or to discharge a person because of race or another
characteristic. And the catch-all language, "otherwise to discriminate," is
similarly active. The Supreme Court has held that this language creates liability
only for acts of intentional discrimination.
By contrast, section 703(a)(2) makes it unlawful "to limit, segregate, or
classify ... employees or applicants for employment in any way which would
deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities or
otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee, because of such individual’s
race, color, religion, sex, or national origin." This is the language that the
Supreme Court has interpreted as giving rise to disparate impact liability. Unlike
the provision we just discussed, section 703(a)(2) contains much more passivesounding prohibited acts, because it reaches conduct that would "tend to deprive"
someone of an employment opportunity or would "otherwise adversely affect his
status as an employee."
The ultimate issue, then, is whether the language of the Fair Housing Act
is more like the "intentional discrimination" provision from Title VII, or more
like the "disparate impact" provision. A comparison of the language answers that
question clearly: the Fair Housing Act is much more similar to the disparate
treatment language in Title VII. Most importantly, the Fair Housing Act does not
use the critical phrases from Title VII prohibiting conduct that may "tend to
deprive" an individual of housing or "adversely affect" the ability to obtain
housing. Faced with this language, and in light of its earlier decisions, I believe
that the Supreme Court will find an absence of Congressional intent to prohibit
conduct that has a disparate impact under the Fair Housing Act. And having
reached that conclusion on the statute's language, all of the other issues like
legislative history or HUD's administrative interpretation of the Act will fall
aside, because the interpretation of a statute ends with the statute's text when its
meaning is clear. That is the reason why I think that Magner will be decided in a
way that prohibits disparate impact claims.

Section 1057 of Dodd-Frank amended Sarbanes Oxley’s retaliation protections
relating to “opposition claims” filed with the Department of Labor (“DOL”) to
include protection for whistleblowers who allege violations of consumer protection
laws subject to enforcement by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
Protects employees from:
providing or attempting or causing to provide information to an employer or
government agency relating to a violation of certain consumer laws
testifying or intending to testify in, or filing, instituting or causing to be filed or
instituted, any proceeding under any federal consumer financial law (TILA,
RESPA, FCRA, ECOA, etc.)
objecting to, or refusing to participate in any activity the employee reasonably
believes violates any laws subject to the CFPB’s jurisdiction
Dodd-Frank brings such individuals into the same anti-retaliation provisions
applicable to securities whistleblowers under Sarbanes-Oxley, as expanded by DoddFrank
Same 180-day limitations period and DOL filing procedure applies to these claims as
to “opposition” claims under Sarbanes-Oxley

material impact on consumers.
l. The term “financial product or service” does not include the business of
insurance or “electronic conduit services” (generally, electronic data
transmission, data storage, or payments).
3. “Covered Person.” The CFPB has authority over any person that engages in
offering or providing a “financial product or service” to a consumer, including
any affiliate of a covered person if the affiliate acts as a “service provider.”
4. The CFPB has rulemaking authority over “federal consumer financial laws”
and is authorized to issue orders and guidance, and take enforcement action as
necessary to implement those laws (§ 1022) (See Notice, “Streamlining Inherited
Regulations,” CFPB, 76 Federal Register 75,825 (Dec. 5, 2011); Interim Final
Rules Transferring Authority to CFPB effective December 30, 2011, e.g.,
“Mortgage Acts and Practices-Advertising (Regulation N); Mortgage Assistance
Relief Services (Regulation O),” CFPB, 76 Federal Register 78,130 (Dec. 16,
2011)). The CFPB will not have rulemaking authority over the Community
Reinvestment Act or the Expedited Funds Availability Act.
a. The CFPB is required to consult with the appropriate prudential
regulators or other federal agencies prior to proposing a rule and during
the comment process regarding consistency with prudential, market, or
systemic objectives.
b. On the petition of a member agency of the FSOC, the FSOC may set
aside a final regulation, in whole or in part, prescribed by the CFPB, if the
FSOC decides, under specified procedures, that the regulation or provision
would put the safety and soundness of the U.S. banking system or the
stability of the U.S. financial system at risk. (§ 1023)
5. The CFPB has examination and supervisory authority over nondepository
institution providers of consumer financial products (§ 1024) and services and,

6

Chapter 2
7 of 32

with respect to consumer financial laws, insured depository institutions with
assets of more than $10 billion and their affiliates (§ 1025). The banking agencies
will continue to examine and supervise compliance with federal consumer
financial laws with respect to insured depository institutions with assets of $10
billion or less, subject to coordination with the CFPB (§ 1026).
F. Office of Financial Research (“OFR”) (§§ 151-156)
1. Established within Treasury under a Director appointed by the President for a
six-year term.
2. Purpose—support the FSOC in fulfilling its purposes and duties by collecting
data on behalf of the FSOC, and providing such data to the FSOC and member
agencies; performing applied research and essential long-term research;
developing tools for risk measurement and monitoring; and performing other
related services (§ 153).
3. During the first two years, the OFR will be funded by an allocation of FRB
funds necessary to cover the operations of the OFR. Thereafter, Treasury will
establish an assessment schedule, including the assessment base and rates,
applicable to bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion
or greater and nonbank financial companies supervised by the FRB to collect
assessments equal to the total expenses of the OFR (§ 155) (See Proposed Rule,
“Assessment of Fees on Large Bank Holding Companies and Nonbank Financial
Companies Supervised by the Federal Reserve Board to Cover the Expenses of
the Financial Research Fund,” Treasury, 77 Federal Register 35 (Jan. 3, 2012)).
III. Deposit Insurance Reforms – Sections 331-336; 343
A. Deposit insurance premiums will be based on an institution’s average consolidated
total assets minus its average tangible equity during the assessment period, rather than its
deposit base. In the case of an insured depository institution that is a custodial bank (as
defined by the FDIC, based on factors including the percentage of total revenues
generated by custodial businesses and the level of assets under custody) or a banker’s
bank, an amount that the FDIC determines is necessary to establish assessments for a
custodial bank or a banker’s bank.
B. The FDIC is given flexibility in its dividend policy so that assessments for deposit
insurance purposes are not procyclical.
C. The reserve ratio of the Deposit Insurance Fund may not be less than 1.35 percent of
the estimated amount of insured deposits or the new assessment base. The upper limit of
1.5 percent on the reserve ratio is removed. The FDIC is required to take such steps as
may be necessary for the reserve ratio of the Deposit Insurance Fund to reach 1.35
percent of estimated insured deposits by September 30, 2020. In setting the assessments
necessary to meet the minimum reserve ratio requirement, the FDIC must offset the effect
of meeting the minimum on insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets
of less than $10 billion. In other words, banks with assets of $10 billion or more will pay

7

Chapter 2
8 of 32

the premiums necessary to bring the reserve ratio from the current minimum of 1.15
percent to 1.35 percent. (See Final Rule, “Assessments, Large Bank Pricing,” FDIC, 76
Federal Register 10,672 (Feb. 25, 2011); Final Rule, “Designated Reserve Ratio,” FDIC,
75 Federal Register 79,286 (Dec. 20, 2010); Proposed Rule, “Assessment Dividends,
Assessment Rates and Designated Reserve Ratio,” FDIC, 75 Federal Register 66,272
(Oct. 27, 2010))
D. The standard maximum insured deposit amount is increased permanently to $250,000
per depositor at each insured institution. The amount applies retroactively to institutions
for which a receiver was appointed between January and October 2008. (See Final Rule,
“Deposit Insurance Regulations; Permanent Increase in Standard Coverage Amount;
Advertisement of Membership; International Banking; Foreign Banks,” Final Rule, 75
Federal Register 49,363 (Aug. 13, 2010))
E. A non interest-bearing transaction account will be fully insured and will not be taken
into account when computing the net amount due to such depositor. This provision has
the effect of continuing the TAG program on a mandatory basis even if a bank opted out
from participation. However, Dodd-Frank does not provide for separate deposit
premiums as is the case for TAG. Effective date: December 31, 2010 until December 31,
2012. (See Final Rule, “Deposit Insurance Regulations; Unlimited Coverage for
Noninterest-Bearing Transaction Accounts,” FDIC, 75 Federal Register 69,577 (Nov. 15,
2010); Final Rule, “Deposit Insurance Regulations; Unlimited Coverage for NoninterestBearing Transaction Accounts; Inclusion of Interest on Lawyers Trust Accounts,” FDIC,
76 Federal Register 4,813 (Jan. 27, 2011))
F. Orderly Liquidation Authority—Title II. (See Interim Final Rule, “Orderly
Liquidation Authority Provisions of the [DFA],” FDIC, 76 Federal Register 4,207 (Jan.
25, 2011))
IV. New Regulatory Restrictions, Limitations, and Other Changes
A. Capital Requirements – Sections 171, 606, 616
1. A financial holding company (“FHC”) must be well capitalized and well
managed as a condition of engaging in expanded financial activities.
2. The FRB is authorized to issue regulations imposing capital requirements on
bank holding companies. The FRB is required to “seek” to make such
requirements countercyclical allowing for decreases in requirements during times
of economic contraction.
3. Collins Amendment. The banking agencies are required to set capital
requirements for insured institutions and holding companies with the existing
minimum capital ratios applicable to depository institutions serving as a floor.
(See Final Rule, “Risk-Based Capital Standards: Advanced Capital Adequacy
Framework—Basel II; Establishment of a Risk-Based Capital Floor,” OCC, FRB,
and FDIC, 76 Federal Register 37,620 (Jun. 28, 2011))

8

Chapter 2
9 of 32

a. Debt and equity instruments issued by a holding company that would
not qualify as capital for a bank but issued prior to May 19, 2010 will be
phased out for institutions that have $15 billion or more of assets. The
phase out will commence on January 1, 2013 and run for three years.
b. A holding company that had total consolidated assets of less than $15
billion as of December 31, 2009 may continue to include trust preferred
securities (“TRUPS”) issued before May 19, 2010 in Tier 1 capital.
Preferred stock issued under TARP continues status as Tier 1 capital.
c. Bank holding company subsidiaries of foreign banking organizations
that have relied on SR 01-1 have a five-year deferred effective date before
the requirements apply.
d. The holding company capital requirements will not apply to bank
holding companies subject to the FRB Small Bank Holding Company
Policy Statement ($500 million or less of assets).
e. Subject to recommendations of the FSOC, the banking agencies are
required to develop capital requirements that address the risks that the
activities of a banking organization pose to the institution as well as
public and private stakeholders in the event of adverse performance,
disruption, or failure of the institution or the activity. The rules should
address the risks arising from (i) significant volumes of activity in
derivatives, securitized products purchased and sold, financial guarantees
purchased and sold, securities borrowing and lending, and repurchase
agreements and reverse repurchase agreements; (ii) concentrations in
assets for which values are based on models rather than cost or prices
derived from liquid markets; and (iii) concentrations in market share for
any activity that would substantially disrupt financial markets if the
institution was forced to cease the activity unexpectedly. (See Proposed
Rule, “Risk-Based Capital Rules: Market Risk,” OCC, FRB, and FDIC, 76
Federal Register 1,890 (Jan. 11, 2011))
4. The banking agencies are also required to “seek” to make capital requirements
countercyclical allowing for decreases in requirements during times of economic
contraction.
5. Source of Financial Strength. A holding company is required to serve as a
source of financial strength, i.e., the ability to provide financial assistance in the
event of the financial distress of the insured institution, to an insured institution
subsidiary.2 Effective date: July 21, 2011, with regulations to be issued by July
21, 2012.

2

The requirement also applies to a company that controls an insured institution that is not the subsidiary of a
holding company. Because a company that has control of an insured institution would be a bank or thrift holding
company, this requirement serves no purpose.

9

Chapter 2
10 of 32

B. Transactions with Affiliates – Section 608
1. Any investment fund advised by a bank or an affiliate will be an “affiliate” for
purposes of Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act. Previously, certain funds
had to be “sponsored and advised” by the bank or an affiliate.
2. Definition of “covered transaction”
a. Clarified to treat a repurchase agreement as an extension of credit
rather than as a purchase of assets.
b. Expanded to include a borrowing or lending of securities to the extent
the transaction causes a bank or subsidiary to have credit exposure to an
affiliate. Will be subject to the collateral requirement.
c. Expanded to include a derivative transaction with an affiliate to the
extent the transaction causes the bank or subsidiary to have credit
exposure to the affiliate. Will be subject to the collateral requirement.
d. A “covered transaction” will include a loan secured by “debt
obligations” of an affiliate in addition to loans secured by “securities”
issued by an affiliate.
3. The FRB will continue to have authority to issue “orders” as may be necessary
to administer and carry out the purposes of Section 23A, but it will no longer have
authority to issue orders to grant exemptions on its own. Exemptions for
relationships and transactions must be granted by regulation.
a. The FRB must notify the FDIC of a finding that a proposed exemption
is in the public interest and consistent with the purposes of Section 23A.
b. The FDIC will have 60 days to object in writing to the proposed
exemption on the basis that it determined that the exemption would
present an unacceptable risk to the Deposit Insurance Fund.
c. The OCC may exempt a transaction of a national bank by order with
the concurrence of the FDIC.
d. The FRB may exempt a transaction of a state member bank and the
FDIC may exempt a transaction of a state nonmember bank by order if the
FRB and the FDIC jointly find that the exemption is in the public interest
and the FDIC finds that the exemption does not present an unacceptable
risk to the Deposit Insurance Fund.
e. The FRB must also receive a written no-objection from the FDIC in
order to grant an exemption or exclusion under Section 23B.

10

Chapter 2
11 of 32

4. The FRB is authorized to issue regulations or interpretations concerning the
extent to which a netting arrangement with an affiliate may be taken into account
in determining the amount of a covered transaction and whether a transaction is
fully collateralized. Any interpretations issued with respect to an individual
institution must be issued jointly with the appropriate federal banking agency for
the institution.
5. Section 609 subjects transactions between a bank and a “financial subsidiary”
to the individual affiliate amount limitation (10 percent of capital and surplus).
However, only transactions entered into on or after July 21, 2010 will be subject
to the 10 percent limit.
6. Effective date: July 21, 2012.
C. Limits on Purchase of Assets from Insiders – Section 615
1. In order for a bank to purchase an asset from or sell an asset to an insider
(executive officer, director, principal shareholder, or one of their related interests),
the transaction must be on market terms and, if the transaction represents more
than 10 percent of the capital of the bank, the board of the bank, excluding
interested parties, must approve the transaction in advance. This provision
replaces existing Section 22(d) of the Federal Reserve Act concerning certain
transactions with directors.
2. The FRB may adopt rules to implement this provision in consultation with the
OCC and FDIC.
3. Effective date: July 21, 2011.
D. Lending Limits for Derivatives – Sections 610, 611, 614
1. The definition of “loans and extensions of credit” in Section 84 of the National
Bank Act is amended to include credit exposure arising from a derivative
transaction3, repurchase agreement, reverse repurchase agreement, securities
lending transaction, or securities borrowing transaction. Effective date: July 21,
2012.
2. Amends the FDI Act to condition the ability of a state insured bank to engage
in a derivative transaction on whether the law on lending limits of the chartering
state takes into consideration credit exposure on derivatives transactions.
Effective date: January 21, 2013.
3. Credit exposure on a derivative transaction, repurchase agreement, reverse
repurchase agreement, securities lending transaction, or securities borrowing
3

A “derivative transaction” includes any transaction that is a contract, agreement, swap, warrant, note, or option that
is based, in whole or in part, on the value of, any interest in, or any quantitative measure or the occurrence of any
event relating to, one or more commodities, securities, currencies, interest or other rates, indices, or other assets.

11

Chapter 2
12 of 32

transaction will be subject to the lending limit applicable to loans to insiders
under Regulation O. Effective date: July 21, 2012.
E. De Novo Branching – Section 613
A state or national bank may establish a branch in any state if a state bank located
in that state is permitted to establish the branch. Effective date: July 22, 2010.
F. Payment of Interest on Demand Deposits – Section 627
The prohibitions against payment of interest on demand deposits were repealed
effective July 21, 2011. Thus, banks and thrifts may pay interest on corporate
transaction accounts. (See Final Rule, “Prohibition Against Payment of Interest
on Demand Deposits,” FRB, 76 Federal Register 42,015 (Jul. 18, 2011); Final
Rule, “Interest on Deposits; Deposit Insurance Coverage,” FDIC, 76 Federal
Register 41,392 (Jul. 14, 2011))
G. “Volcker Rule” – Section 619
1. Under new Section 13 of the BHC Act, subject to exceptions, a bank, a bank
holding company, a foreign bank, a subsidiary or an affiliate of a bank, bank
holding company, or foreign bank (all are “banking entities”4),5 will not be
permitted to engage in “proprietary trading” or acquire retain any equity,
partnership, or other ownership interest in, or sponsor a “hedge fund” or a
“private equity fund.”
2. Generally, the prohibition will be effective no later than July 21, 2012.
Implementation of the provisions requires completion of a study by the FSOC on
proprietary trading and hedge and private equity sponsorship and investment by
banking entities (See “Study & Recommendations on Prohibitions on Proprietary
Trading & Certain Relationships with Hedge Funds & Private Equity Funds,”
FSOC (Jan. 2011)) and the issuance of regulations by the banking agencies jointly
for banks, the FRB, the SEC, and the CFTC (See Proposed Rule, “Prohibitions
and Restrictions on Proprietary Trading and Certain Interests in, and
Relationships with, Hedge Funds and Private Equity Funds,” OCC, FRB, FDIC,
and SEC, 76 Federal Register 68,846 (Nov. 7, 2011); CFTC also issued a
Proposed Rule, which was not yet published as of January 27, 2012). The
regulations are required to address additional capital requirements related to
holding ownership interests and sponsoring hedge funds and private equity funds.
3. Transition Period. A transition period of two years is provided with the
possibility of obtaining extensions.

4

An exception is provided for trust companies that accept deposits only in a fiduciary capacity and that meet certain
other conditions and limits on activities.
5
The Volcker Rule also applies to nonbank systemically important financial institutions supervised by the FRB.
Such institutions are defined in section 102 and will be designated by the FSOC.

12

Chapter 2
13 of 32

a. A banking entity must bring its activities and investments into
compliance not later than two years after the effective date. The FRB may
grant up to three one-year extensions, so long as an extension is consistent
with the Volcker Rule and is not detrimental to the public interest.
b. Illiquid Funds. The FRB may grant an extension of the transition
period to a banking entity to the extent necessary to fulfill a contractual
obligation that was in effect on May 1, 2010. During the extension, the
banking entity may take or retain its ownership interest in or otherwise
provide additional capital to an illiquid fund. The FRB may grant one
extension that may not exceed five years. A banking entity may not
engage in any prohibited fund activity after the earlier of the date on
which the contractual obligation to invest in the illiquid fund terminates
and the date on which extensions granted by the FRB expire.
c. The FRB adopted rules to implement the transition periods (See Final
Rule, “Conformance Period for Entities Engaged in Prohibited Proprietary
Trading or Private Equity Fund or Hedge Fund Activities,” FRB, 76
Federal Register 8,265 (Feb. 14, 2011)).
4. Key Definitions
a. “Proprietary trading” means engaging as a principal for the trading
account of the banking entity in any transaction to purchase or sell or
otherwise acquire or dispose of, any security, any derivative, any contract
of sale of a commodity for future delivery, any option on any such
security, derivative or contract, or any other security or financial
instrument designated by regulations (“securities and other instruments”).
b. “Trading account” means any account used for acquiring or taking
positions in securities and other instruments principally for the purpose of
selling in the near-term (or otherwise with the intent to resell in order to
profit from short-term price movements).
c. “Hedge fund” and “private equity fund” mean an issuer that would be
an “investment company” but for the exceptions in sections 3(c)(1) and
3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act of 1940.
d. “Illiquid fund” means a hedge fund or private equity fund that, as of
May 1, 2010, was principally invested in, or was invested and
contractually committed to invest principally in, illiquid assets such as
portfolio companies, real estate investments, and venture capital
investments and makes all investments under, and consistent with, an
investment strategy to invest principally in illiquid assets. In adopting
rules, the FRB must consider the terms of investment for the fund,
contractual obligations, and the ability of the fund to divest of assets, and
other factors that it determines to be appropriate.

13

Chapter 2
14 of 32

d. “Sponsor” means to serve as a general partner, managing member, or
trustee of a fund; to select a majority of the directors or management of a
fund; or share with a fund the same name or a variation of the same name.
5. Permitted Activities. The agencies are authorized by Section 619 to permit
banking entities to engage in the following activities:
a. Purchase and sale of U.S. Government, Agency, and GSE obligations,
and obligations of any state or political subdivision;
b. Purchase and sale of securities and other instruments in connection
with underwriting and market-making activities to the extent designed not
to exceed the reasonably expected near-term demands of clients,
customers, or counterparties;
c. Hedging activities related to individual or aggregated positions,
contracts, or other holdings of the banking entity designed to reduce the
specific risks related to the position;
d. Purchase and sale of securities and other instruments on behalf of a
customer;
e. Holding an investment in a Small Business Investment Company, a
public welfare investment, or a qualified rehabilitation expenditure
investment;
f. Insurance company investing activity;
g. Organizing and offering a private equity or hedge fund if the banking
entity provides bona fide trust, fiduciary, or investment advisory services
and the fund is organized and offered only in connection with the
provision of those services and only to persons that are customers of such
services of the banking entity (“Fiduciary Fund”).
i. The banking entity may serve as a general partner, managing
member, or trustee of the Fiduciary Fund, and otherwise control
the Fund, its management, and its expenses.
ii. The banking entity may hold only a de minimis investment in a
Fiduciary Fund that is not more than 3 percent of the total
ownership interests of the Fund. The aggregate of all interests in
such funds of a banking entity may not exceed 3 percent of the
Tier 1 capital of the banking entity.
iii. A banking entity may provide a Fiduciary Fund with initial
startup equity but it must actively seek unaffiliated investors to
reduce or dilute its investment to 3 percent or less than the
ownership interests of the Fund within one year from the date of

14

Chapter 2
15 of 32

establishment of the fund (an extension of up to two years may be
available).
iv. In calculating compliance with any capital requirements under
regulations implementing the Volcker Rule, a banking entity must
deduct the outstanding amount of any Fiduciary Fund investments,
including retained earnings, from the assets and tangible equity of
the banking entity. The amount of the deductions must increase
commensurate with the leverage of the Fund.
v. A banking entity and its affiliates may not enter into a “covered
transaction” (as defined under Regulation W) with a Fiduciary
Fund that is organized and offered, by the banking entity. Such
transactions are also prohibited for a hedge or private equity fund
controlled by the banking entity’s fund. Transactions between a
banking entity and a Fiduciary Fund will be subject to Section 23B
of the Federal Reserve Act.
vi. A banking entity may not guarantee the obligations or the
performance of a Fiduciary Fund.
vii. A banking entity may not share the same name or variation of
the same name with a Fiduciary Fund.
viii. Among persons affiliated with a banking entity, only the
directors or employees of the banking entity who are directly
engaged in providing investment advisory or other services to the
Fiduciary Fund may take or retain an ownership interest in the
Fund.
ix. The banking entity must provide a disclosure in writing to
prospective and actual investors in a Fiduciary Fund that any losses
in the Fund are borne solely by investors in the Fund;
h. Trading that takes place entirely outside the United States and the
banking entity is not controlled by a banking entity that is organized under
U.S. law;
i. The acquisition of an ownership interest in, or the sponsorship of, a
hedge fund or a private equity fund by a banking entity solely outside of
the United States, provided that no ownership interest in the fund is
offered for sale or sold to a U.S. resident and that the banking entity is not
controlled by a banking entity that is organized under U.S. law; and
j. Other activities determined by the federal banking agencies, the SEC,
and the CFTC that would promote and protect the safety and soundness of
the banking entity and the financial stability of the United States.

15

Chapter 2
16 of 32

6. Limitations and Conditions on Permitted Activities.
a. A transaction or activity will not be permitted if it would (i) involve or
result in a material conflict of interest between the banking entity and its
customers or counterparties, (ii) result in a material exposure of the
banking entity to high-risk assets or high-risk trading strategies, (iii) pose
a threat to the safety and soundness of the banking entity, or (iv) pose a
threat to the financial stability of the United States.
b. The agencies may impose additional capital requirements, quantitative
limits, and diversification requirements on the permitted activities if the
agencies determine that the conditions are appropriate to protect the safety
and soundness of the banking entities engaged in such activities.
c. The regulations adopted by the agencies must include requirements
related to internal controls and recordkeeping in order to ensure
compliance.
7. Conditions Specific to Hedge Fund and Private Equity Fund Activities
a. Prohibition on Covered Transactions. The prohibition on entering into
covered transactions with Fiduciary Funds extends to a private equity or
hedge fund that is advised, managed, or sponsored, by a banking entity.
Section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act will apply to the banking entity
and its affiliates and their transactions with a fund that the banking entity
advises, manages, sponsors, organizes, or offers.
b. Prime Brokerage Transactions. The FRB may permit a banking entity
to enter into any prime brokerage transaction with any hedge fund or
private equity fund in which a fund managed, sponsored, or advised by the
banking entity has an ownership interest if the banking entity is in
compliance with all of the conditions related to its Fiduciary Funds.
8. Override Provisions
a. The prohibitions and restrictions of the Volcker Rule override any
provision of law that authorizes an activity that is otherwise prohibited or
limited by the Volcker Rule.
b. Nothing in the Volcker Rule may be construed to limit or restrict the
ability of a banking entity to sell or securitize loans in a manner otherwise
permitted by law.
c. The Volcker Rule may not be construed to limit the powers of federal
agencies and state regulatory authorities to act under otherwise applicable
provisions of law.

16

Chapter 2
17 of 32

H. Issues in Approval of Applications
1. Agencies must consider whether an acquisition or merger proposal will have
an adverse effect on the stability of the U.S. financial system. § 604(d), (e), (f).
2. Establishes a nationwide concentration cap of 10 percent of the aggregate
consolidated liabilities of all financial companies at the end of the calendar year
preceding the transaction. § 622
3. The resulting bank in an interstate acquisition must be well capitalized and
well managed and a bank holding company must be well managed and well
capitalized in order to complete an interstate acquisition. § 607.
4. An interstate bank merger or holding company acquisition is subject to a
concentration cap of 10 percent of the total amount of deposits of all depository
institutions in the United States. § 623.
5. A financial holding company must obtain prior FRB approval for any
acquisition of a nonbank company with more than $10 billion in assets. A filing
under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act would be required even though the transaction
would be subject to FRB approval. § 604(e).
6. Limits imposed on charter conversions of a bank that is subject to a banking
agency enforcement action. § 612.
7. The FRB in considering an application by a foreign bank to establish a U.S.
office and the SEC in considering whether to permit a foreign person or an
affiliate of a foreign person to register as a U.S. broker or dealer must consider,
for a foreign bank or broker-dealer that presents a risk to the stability of United
States financial system, whether the home country of the foreign bank has
adopted, or is making demonstrable progress toward adopting, an appropriate
system of financial regulation for the financial system of such home country to
mitigate such risk.
I. No Use of Ratings – Sections 939 and 939A
1. Amends the FDI Act and the National Bank Act to delete the terms “investment
grade” and “credit rating” and substitutes standards of creditworthiness
established or issued by the applicable agency. (See Proposed Rule, “Alternatives
to the Use of External Credit Ratings in the Regulations of the OCC,” 76 Federal
Register 73,526 (Nov. 29, 2011) (Correction, 76 Federal Register 76,095 (Dec. 9,
2011)); Proposed Guidance, “Guidance on Due Diligence Requirements in
Determining Whether Investment Securities Are Eligible for Investment,” 76
Federal Register 73,777 (Nov. 29, 2011); Proposed Rule, “Permissible
Investments for Federal and State Savings Associations: Corporate Debt
Securities,” FDIC, 76 Federal Register 78,086 (Dec., 15, 2011))

17

Chapter 2
18 of 32

2. The agencies proposed to incorporate into proposed market risk capital rules
certain alternative methodologies for calculating specific risk capital requirements
for debt and securitization positions that do not rely on credit ratings (See
Proposed Rule, “Risk-Based Capital Guidelines: Market Risk; Alternatives to
Credit Ratings for Debt and Securitization Positions,” OCC, FRB, and FDIC, 76
Federal Register 79,380 (Dec. 21, 2011); Proposed Rule, “Alternatives to the Use
of Credit Ratings in the Risk-Based Capital Guidelines of the Federal Banking
Agencies,” OCC, FRB, and FDIC, 75 Federal Register 52,283 (Aug. 25, 2010))
J. Risk Committees and Stress Tests – Section 165
1. Publicly traded bank holding companies with $10 billion or more in assets will
be required to have a risk committee of the board of directors; the FRB may
require publicly traded bank holding companies with less than $10 billion in
assets to have a risk committee.
2. A risk committee will be responsible for the oversight of the enterprise-wide
risk management practices of the bank holding company and include the number
of independent directors as the FRB may determine appropriate, based on the
nature of operations, size of assets, and other appropriate criteria related to the
bank holding company; and include at least one risk management expert having
experience in identifying, assessing, and managing risk exposures of large,
complex firms.
3. The FRB is required to issue final rules not later than July 21, 2012, to take
effect not later than October 21, 2013.
4. A nonbank financial company supervised by the FRB and a bank holding
company with more than $50 billion of assets will be required to conduct
semiannual stress tests. All other financial companies that have total consolidated
assets of more than $10 billion and are regulated by a primary Federal financial
regulatory agency must conduct annual stress tests and publish the results. (See
Proposed Rule, “Annual Stress Test,” OCC, 77 Federal Register 3,408 (Jan. 24,
2012); Proposed Rule, “Annual Stress Test,” FDIC 77 Federal Register 3,166
(Jan.23, 2012))
5. A stress test will generally provide for at least 3 different sets of conditions,
including baseline, adverse, and severely adverse.
K. Executive Compensation – Section 956
1. Requires the agencies to prohibit incentive-based payment arrangements, or
any feature of any such arrangement, at a covered financial institution that the
agencies determine encourages inappropriate risks by a financial institution by
providing excessive compensation or that could lead to material financial loss.
2. A covered financial institution also must disclose to its appropriate Federal
regulator the structure of its incentive based compensation arrangements

18

Chapter 2
19 of 32

sufficient to determine whether the structure provides “excessive compensation,
fees, or benefits” or “could lead to material financial loss” to the institution.
3. The agencies issued a proposed rule that would require the reporting of
incentive-based compensation arrangements by a covered financial institution and
prohibit incentive-based compensation arrangements at a covered financial
institution that provides excessive compensation or that could expose the
institution to inappropriate risks that could lead to material financial loss. (See
Proposed Rule, “Incentive-Based Compensation Arrangements,” OCC, FRB,
FDIC, FHFA, and NCUA, 76 Federal Register 21,170 (Apr. 14, 2011))
L. Asset-Backed Securities
1. Conflicts of Interest -- Section 621
a. An underwriter, placement agent, initial purchaser, or sponsor (and
their affiliates) of an asset-backed security (“ABS”) may not for one year
after the first closing of the sale of the ABS engage in a transaction that
involves or results in a material conflict of interest with respect to any
investor in a transaction arising out of such activity.
b. The prohibition would not apply to hedging activity, purchases and
sales of ABS made under, and consistent with, the role of an underwriter,
placement agent, initial purchaser or sponsor to provide liquidity for the
ABS or bona fide market-making in the security.
2. Risk Retention – Section 941
a. The SEC and the banking agencies are required to issue regulations to
require a “securitizer”6 to retain an economic interest in a portion of the
credit risk for any asset that the securitizer transfers, sells, or conveys to a
third party through an ABS. (See Proposed Rule, “Credit Risk Retention,”
OCC, FRB, FDIC, FHFA, SEC, and HUD, 76 Federal Register 24,090
(Apr. 29, 2011))
b. The SEC, the banking agencies, HUD, and FHA are required to issue
regulations to require a securitizer to retain an economic interest in a
portion of the credit risk for any residential mortgage that the securitizer
transfers, sells, or conveys to a third party through an ABS.
c. Standards to Be Incorporated in Regulations
i. A securitizer will be prohibited from hedging or otherwise
transferring the retained credit risk;

6

“Securitizer” means an issuer of an ABS or a person who organizes and initiates an ABS transaction by selling or
transferring assets to the issuer

19

Chapter 2
20 of 32

ii. A securitizer will be required to retain not less than five percent of
the credit risk for any asset that is not a “qualified residential
mortgage”7 or less than five percent of the credit risk for nonqualified mortgage assets if the originator8 of the asset meets
prescribed underwriting standards;
iii. Permissible forms and minimum duration of risk retention;
iv. Apply to all securitizers, including nondepository institutions;
v. Regulations related to commercial mortgages will also address the
effect of a third-party purchaser of a first loss position, adequate
underwriting standards, and adequate representations and warranties
and related enforcement mechanisms;
vi. Appropriate standards for risk retention related to CDOs and
similar instruments;
vii. Total or partial exemptions in the public interest and for the
protection of investors, for U.S. government or agency backed ABS,9
and for state or political subdivision backed ABS;
viii. Allocation of risk retention between a securitizer and an
originator in the case of a securitizer that purchases assets from an
originator; and
ix. Asset classes with separate rules for securitizers that will include
underwriting standards for loans within the asset classes.
d. Exemptions. Any exemptions must help ensure high quality
underwriting standards for the securitizers and originators of assets for
ABS and encourage appropriate risk management practices by securitizers
and originators, improve the access of consumers and business to credit on
reasonable terms, or otherwise be in the public interest for the protection
of investors.
e. The agencies are required to establish an exemption from the risk
retention requirements for “qualified residential mortgages” taking into
account underwriting and product features that historical loan performance
indicate result in a lower risk of default, such as documentation,
verification of income, payments to income, insurance, and prohibiting or
restricting the use of balloon payments, negative amortization, prepayment
7

No risk retention is required if all of the assets collateralizing an ABS are qualified residential mortgages. A
securitizer will be required to retain a portion of the credit risk of qualified residential mortgages included in a
mixed pool of assets.
8
“Originator” means a person who through the extension of credit or otherwise creates a financial asset that
collateralizes an ABS and sells an asset to a securitizer.
9
For this purpose, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are not U.S. government agencies.

20

Chapter 2

penalties, interest-only payments, and other features that demonstrate a
higher risk of borrower default.10
f. Effective date of regulations—one year after publication of final
regulations for residential mortgages and two years after publication of
final regulations for all other classes of ABS.
3. The SEC is required to adopt rules for disclosures for ABS that facilitate
comparison of securities in similar asset classes and disclose asset-level or loanlevel data. (§ 942)
4. The SEC is required to adopt regulations regarding the use of representations
and warranties in the market for ABS and to disclose fulfilled and unfulfilled
repurchase requests so that investors may identify originators with clear
underwriting deficiencies (§ 943) and require an issuer of an ABS to perform, and
disclose, a review of the assets underlying the ABS (§ 945).
5. The exemption from registration under the Securities Act of 1933 for certain
ABS is removed. (§ 944)
V. Consumer Regulatory Changes
A. Prohibited Acts – Sections 1031, 1036
1. The CFPB may act to prevent a covered person or service provider from
committing or engaging in an unfair, deceptive, or abusive act or practice in
connection with any transaction with a consumer for a consumer financial product
or service, or the offering of a consumer financial product or service.
a. “Unfair” — the act or practice causes or is likely to cause substantial
injury to consumers that is not reasonably avoidable and the substantial
injury is not outweighed by countervailing benefits to consumers or to
competition.
b. “Abusive”— the act or practice materially interferes with the ability of
a consumer to understand a term or condition of a consumer financial
product or service or takes unreasonable advantage of a lack of
understanding of the consumer of the material risks, costs, or conditions of
the product or service, the inability of the consumer to protect his own
interests in selecting or using a product or service, or the reasonable
reliance by the consumer on a covered person to act in the interests of the
consumer.
2. It is unlawful for a covered person or service provider to offer or provide to a
consumer any financial product or service not in conformity with federal
10

The definition of “qualified residential mortgage” will be no broader than the definition of “qualified mortgage”
under section 129C(c)(2) of the Truth in Lending Act.

21

Chapter 2
22 of 32

consumer financial law; commit an act or omission in violation of federal
consumer financial law; to engage in any unfair, deceptive, or abusive act or
practice; to fail to or refuse to permit access to or copying of records; to establish
or maintain records; or make or provide reports to the CFPB.
B. Pre-Emption – Title X, Subtitle D (Sections 1041-1048)
1. Relation of Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (“Title X”) to State
Law – Section 1041
a. A state law may be overridden by Title X only if the provision of state
law is inconsistent with Title X and then only to the extent of the
inconsistency. A state law is not inconsistent with Title X if the protection
afforded to consumers is greater than the protection under Title X. The
CFPB may make a determination regarding the inconsistency of a state
law on its own motion or in response to a petition.
b. The CFPB must issue a notice of proposed rulemaking when a majority
of states have enacted a resolution in support of establishing or modifying
a consumer regulation by the CFPB.
2. State Enforcement Powers – Section 1042
a. A state may bring a civil action in a state or federal court in the state
that has jurisdiction over the defendant to enforce Title X or any rules
issued under Title X. Actions against national banks and federal thrifts are
limited to enforcement of regulations issued under Title X.
b. The state attorney general or regulator must give notice to the CFPB
prior to filing a complaint to enforce Title X or an applicable rule by
providing a complete copy of the complaint and a written description of
the action. The CFPB may intervene, remove the action to federal court
(if applicable), be heard on all matters, and appeal any order or judgment.
3. Contracts entered into prior to July 21, 2010 that relied on a pre-emption
regulation, order, guidance, or interpretation issued by the OCC or OTS remain
valid for institutions regulated by the OCC and OTS as well as their subsidiaries.
(§ 1043)
4. State Law Preemption Standard for National Banks and Federal Branches –
Section 1044
a. State consumer financial laws are preempted only if
i. Application of the law would have a discriminatory effect on
national banks in comparison with the effect of the law on a state
bank;

22

Chapter 2
23 of 32

ii. The state law prevents or significantly interferes with the exercise
by the national bank of its powers under the standard in Barnett Bank
as determined by the OCC or a court on a case-by-case basis; or
iii. The state consumer financial law is preempted by federal law
other than Title X.
b. Dodd-Frank expressly states that Title X does not occupy the field in
any area of state law.
c. No OCC preemption rule or order may be interpreted or applied to
invalidate the provision of the state consumer financial law unless
substantial evidence made on the record of the proceeding supports that
the preemption finding was made in accordance with the standard of
Barnett Bank.
d. The OCC is required to conduct a formal review of its preemption
determinations at two five-year intervals following issuance of the
determination.
e. State consumer financial laws expressly apply to a subsidiary or
affiliate of a national bank (other than a national bank) to the same
extent that the state consumer financial law applies to any person
subject to the state law.
f. Title X does not affect the authority of a national bank to charge interest
under section 85 of the National Bank Act.
5. Visitorial Powers. Dodd-Frank adopts the decision in Cuomo v. Clearing
House Association so that no provision relating to visitorial powers or that
otherwise limits or restricts the visitorial authority to which any national bank
is subject may be construed as limiting or restricting the authority of any
attorney general of any state to bring an action against a national bank in a
court to enforce an applicable law and to seek relief as authorized. (§ 1047)
6. Effective date: July 21, 2011.
C. Reasonable Interchange Transaction Fees – Section 1075
The FRB issued regulations regarding any interchange transaction fee that an issuer may
receive or charge with respect to an electronic debit transaction. The amount of any
interchange transaction fee that an issuer may receive or charge with respect to an
electronic debit transaction must be reasonable and proportional to the cost incurred by
the issuer with respect to the transaction. The regulations will not apply to any issuer
that, together with its affiliates, has assets of less than $10 billion. (See Interim Final
Rule and Final Rule, “Debit Card Interchange Fees and Routing,” 76 Federal Register
43,478 (Jul. 20, 2011))

23

Chapter 2
24 of 32

D. Credit Card Complaints
Section 1013(b)(3)(C) requires the CFPB to report annually to Congress information and
analysis about complaint numbers, types, and, when applicable, resolution. CFPB issued
a proposed policy statement that addresses its proactive disclosure of credit card
complaint data it receives from consumers under the terms of the Consumer Financial
Protection Act of 2010. The proposed policy statement sets forth the CFPB’s proposed
initial disclosure of credit card complaint data. It also identifies additional ways that the
CFPB may disclose credit card complaint data but as to which the CFPB will conduct
further study before finalizing its position. (See Proposed Policy Statement, “Disclosure
of Certain Credit Card Complaint Data,” CFPB, 76 Federal Register 76,628 (Dec. 8,
2011))
E. Mortgage Loan Originations – Title XIV (“Mortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory
Lending Act”)
1. Title XIV includes provisions that are designed to assure that consumers are
offered and receive residential mortgage loans on terms that reasonably reflect
their ability to repay the loans and that are understandable and not unfair,
deceptive, or abusive. Effective Date: Regulations must be issued no later than
January 21, 2013 and the rules must be effective within 12 months after issuance.
2. Duty of Care. Each mortgage originator must be qualified and, when required,
registered and licensed as a mortgage originator and include on all loan
documents any unique identifier of the mortgage originator provided by the
Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry. The CFPB will prescribe
regulations requiring banks to establish and maintain procedures reasonably
designed to assure and monitor compliance by banks, their subsidiaries, and their
employees.
3. Yield-Spread Premiums. For any residential mortgage loan, no mortgage
originator may receive from any person and no person may pay to a mortgage
originator, directly or indirectly, compensation that varies based on the terms of
the loan (other than the amount of the principal).
4. Restructuring of Financing Origination Fee. For any mortgage loan, a
mortgage originator may not receive from any person other than the consumer and
no person, other than the consumer, who knows or has reason to know that a
consumer has directly compensated or will directly compensate a mortgage
originator may pay a mortgage originator any origination fee or charge except
bona fide third party charges not retained by the creditor, mortgage originator, or
an affiliate of the creditor or mortgage originator.
5. Steering. The CFPB will prescribe regulations to prohibit
a. Mortgage originators from steering any consumer to a residential
mortgage loan that (i) the consumer lacks a reasonable ability to repay or

24

Chapter 2
25 of 32

(ii) has predatory characteristics or effects (such as equity stripping,
excessive fees, or abusive terms);
b. Mortgage originators from steering any consumer from a residential
mortgage loan for which the consumer is qualified that is a “qualified
mortgage” to a residential mortgage loan that is not a qualified mortgage;
c. Abusive or unfair lending practices that promote disparities among
consumers of equal creditworthiness but of different race, ethnicity,
gender, or age; and
d. Mortgage originators from (i) mischaracterizing the credit history of a
consumer or the residential mortgage loans available to a consumer; (ii)
mischaracterizing or suborning the mischaracterization of the appraised
value of the property securing the extension of credit; or (iii) if unable to
suggest, offer, or recommend to a consumer a loan that is not more
expensive than a loan for which the consumer qualifies, discouraging a
consumer from seeking a residential mortgage loan secured by a
consumer’s principal dwelling from another mortgage originator.
6. Ability to Repay. No creditor may make a residential mortgage loan unless the
creditor makes a reasonable and good faith determination based on verified and
documented information that, at the time the loan is consummated, the consumer
has a reasonable ability to repay the loan, according to its terms, and all applicable
taxes, insurance (including mortgage guarantee insurance), and assessments. (See
Proposed Rule, “Regulation Z; Truth in Lending,” FRB, 76 Federal Register
27,390 (May 11, 2011))
a. A determination of a consumer’s ability to repay a residential mortgage
loan must include consideration of the consumer’s credit history, current
income, expected income the consumer is reasonably assured of receiving,
current obligations, debt-to-income ratio or the residual income the
consumer will have after paying non-mortgage debt and mortgage-related
obligations, employment status, and other financial resources other than
the consumer’s equity in the dwelling or real property that secures
repayment of the loan.
b. A creditor must determine the ability of the consumer to repay using a
payment schedule that fully amortizes the loan over the term of the loan.
c. A creditor making a residential mortgage loan must verify amounts of
income or assets relied on to determine repayment ability, including
expected income or assets, by reviewing the consumer’s Form W–2, tax
returns, payroll receipts, financial institution records, or other third-party
documents that provide reasonably reliable evidence of the consumer’s
income or assets.

25

Chapter 2
26 of 32

d. A consumer’s ability to repay a variable rate residential mortgage loan
that allows or requires the consumer to defer the repayment of any
principal or interest, the creditor must use a fully amortizing repayment
schedule.
7. Qualified Mortgages. Exempt from certain requirements and have certain safe
harbors available. The term “qualified mortgage” means any residential mortgage
loan—
a. For which the regular periodic payments for the loan may not (I) result
in an increase of the principal balance; or (II) subject to exceptions, allow
the consumer to defer repayment of principal;
b. The terms of which do not result in a balloon payment (a scheduled
payment that is more than twice as large as the average of earlier
scheduled payments);
c. For which the income and financial resources relied upon to qualify the
obligors on the loan are verified and documented;
d. In the case of a fixed rate loan, for which the underwriting process is
based on a payment schedule that fully amortizes the loan over the loan
term and takes into account all applicable taxes, insurance, and
assessments;
e. In the case of an adjustable rate loan, for which the underwriting is
based on the maximum rate permitted under the loan during the first 5
years, and a payment schedule that fully amortizes the loan over the loan
term and takes into account all applicable taxes, insurance, and
assessments;
f. That complies with any guidelines or regulations established by the
CFPB relating to ratios of total monthly debt-to-monthly income or
alternative measures of ability to pay regular expenses after payment of
total monthly debt, taking into account the income levels of the borrower
and such other factors as the CFPB may determine relevant;
g. For which the total points and fees payable in connection with the loan
do not exceed 3 percent of the total loan amount;
h. For which the term of the loan does not exceed 30 years, subject to
exceptions, such as in high-cost areas; and
i. In the case of a reverse mortgage, a reverse mortgage which meets the
standards for a qualified mortgage, as set by rules issued by the CFPB.

26

Chapter 2
27 of 32

8. Appraisals. Dodd-Frank includes provisions on appraiser independence,
appraisal portability, appraiser compensation, registration requirements, and limits
on automated valuation models.
9. Escrow Requirements. A lender will be required to establish an escrow
account for certain closed-end consumer credit secured by a first lien on a
principal dwelling for payment of taxes, hazard insurance, flood insurance,
mortgage insurance, and any other required periodic payments or premiums. This
requirement will generally apply to high-rate loans or otherwise as required by
law.
VI. Derivatives – Title VII
A. Push Out of Swap Activities – Section 716
1. General rule—No “federal assistance” may be provided to any swaps entity
with respect to any swap, security-based swap, or other activity of the swaps
entity. The effect is that a banking organization must conduct its swaps activities,
with certain exceptions, through a non-depository institution affiliate.
2. “Federal assistance” means the use of advances from a Federal Reserve credit
facility, federal deposit insurance or guarantees for the purpose of (i) making any
loan to, or purchasing any stock, equity interest, or debt obligation of, any swaps
entity; (ii) purchasing the assets of any swaps entity; (iii) guaranteeing any loan or
debt issuance of any swaps entity; or (iv) entering into any assistance arrangement
(including tax breaks), loss sharing, or profit sharing with any swaps entity.
3. A bank may be a “major swaps participant” but not a “swaps dealer.” A bank
that engages in swaps activities that are limited to hedging and risk mitigation and
swaps involving rates or reference assets that are permissible for investment by a
national bank11 will be permitted to retain those activities in the bank. As a
practical matter, a bank would have to establish a separate affiliate for swaps
activities if it is a swaps dealer and only for swaps that reference bank
impermissible assets.
4. Effective date: Two years following the date on which Title VII is effective,
which is July 16, 2011 (See Final Order, “Effective Date of Swap Regulation,”
CFTC, 76 Federal Register 42,508 (Jul. 19, 2011); Notice of Proposed
Amendment, “Effective Date of Swap Regulation,” CFTC, 76 Federal Register
65,999 (Oct. 25, 2011)). A federal banking agency may permit a bank up to 24
months to conform activities that require registration as a swaps entity with an
extension of an additional year possible.

11

Acting as a swaps entity for a credit default swap will not be considered a bank permissible activity unless cleared
by a derivatives clearing organization.

27

Chapter 2
28 of 32

5. The prudential regulators are required to issue rules setting minimum standards
for swaps and security-based swaps activities conducted by banks and bank
holding companies.
6. The entities described as eligible for exemptions for activities that may stay in
a bank are “insured depository institutions,” which would not include uninsured
U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks. The agencies appear to have
sufficient rulemaking authority to make the same exemptions available to
branches and agencies under the principles of national treatment and equality of
competitive opportunity.
B. Other Swaps Concepts Affecting Financial Institutions--(§§ 721; 722; 723; 725(g);
763)
1. Swap Dealers and Major Swap Participants will be required to register with the
CFTC. Security-Based Swap Dealers and Major Security-Based Swap
Participants will have to register with the SEC. (See Final Rule, “Registration of
Swap Dealers and Major Swap Participants,” CFTC, 77 Federal Register 2,613
(Jan. 19, 2012))
2. Dealers and Major Participants will be subject to new regulations including
margin requirements, capital requirements, and business conduct standards. (See
Proposed Rule, “Margin Requirements for Uncleared Swaps for Swap Dealers
and Major Swap Participants,” 76 Federal Register 23,732 (Apr. 28, 2011);
Proposed Rule, “Capital Requirements of Swap Dealers and Major Swap
Participants,” CFTC, 76 Federal Register 27,802 (May 12, 2011); Proposed Rule,
“Business Conduct Standards for Swap Dealers and Major Swap Participants with
Counterparties,” CFTC, 75 Federal Register 80,638 (Dec. 22, 2010) (Final Rule
issued by CFTC but not published in Federal Register as of January 27, 2012);
Proposed Rule, “Regulations Establishing and Governing the Duties of Swap
Dealers and Major Swap Participants,” CFTC, 75 Federal Register 71,397 (Nov.
23, 2010))
3. Most financial institutions are expected to be subject to mandatory clearing
and trade execution requirements. The CFTC and SEC are required to consider
whether to exclude certain smaller financial institutions with total assets of $10
billion or less.
4. All market participants, including financial institutions, will be subject to new
swap data reporting and real-time transaction reporting designed to enhance swap
market transparency and pricing. (See Final Rule, “Swap Data Recordkeeping
and Reporting Requirements, CFTC, 77 Federal Register 2,136 (Jan. 13, 2012);
Final Rule, “Real-Time Public Reporting of Swap Transaction Data,” CFTC, 77
Federal Register 1,182 (Jan. 9, 2012); Interim Final Rule, “Reporting Certain
Post-Enactment Swap Transactions,” CFTC, 75 Federal Register 78,892 (Dec. 17,
2010))

Chapter 2
29 of 32

C. Key Terms
1. “Swap”—A swap is broadly defined as any agreement, contract, or transaction
based on an underlying financial product or the occurrence or non-occurrence of
an event relating to a financial product, including interest rate swaps, foreign
exchange swaps, credit default swaps, and commodity swaps. Title VII includes
foreign exchange forwards and swaps within the definition of “swap.” Treasury
is authorized to make a written determination that foreign exchange swaps and
forwards should not be regulated as “swaps” under the DFA. In April 2011,
Treasury issued a proposed determination that would exempt foreign exchange
forwards and swaps for all purposes other than the swap reporting and business
conduct rules (See Request for Comments, “Determination of Foreign Exchange
Swaps and Forwards,” Treasury, 75 Federal Register 66,426 (Oct. 28, 2010)).
The definition of “swap” excludes a number of products including (i) sales of a
nonfinancial commodity or security for deferred shipment or delivery so long as it
is intended to be physically settled, (ii) options on securities, (iii) forwards on
securities, (iv) any note, bond, or evidence of indebtedness which is a security,
and (v) identified banking products such as certificates of deposit.
2. “Security-Based Swap” – A swap that is based on (i) an index that is a narrowbased security index; (ii) a single security or loan, or (iii) the occurrence,
nonoccurrence, or extent of the occurrence of an event relating to a single issuer
of a security or the issuers of securities in a narrow-based security index provided
that the event relates to the financial statements, condition, or obligations of the
issuer.
3. “Major Swap Participant” – A person who is not a “swap dealer” and (i)
maintains a substantial position in swaps for any of the major swap categories
(excluding positions held for hedging commercial risk or risk of an employee
benefit plan); (ii) has outstanding swap counterparty exposure that could have
serious adverse effects on the financial stability of the United States; or (iii) is a
highly leveraged financial entity that that maintains a substantial position in any
major swap category.
4. “Major Security-Based Swap Participant” – A person who is not a “securitybased swap dealer” and (i) maintains a substantial position in security-based
swaps for any of the major security-based swap categories (excluding positions
held for hedging commercial risk or risk of an employee benefit plan); (ii) has
outstanding security-based swap counterparty exposure that could have serious
adverse effects on the financial stability of the United States; or (iii) is a highly
leveraged financial entity that that maintains a substantial position in any major
security-based swap category.
5. “Swap Dealer” – Any person who (i) holds itself out as a dealer in swaps; (ii)
makes a market in swaps; (iii) regularly enters into swaps with counterparties for
its own account; or (iv) engages in any activity causing the person to be
commonly known as a dealer or market maker in swaps. A bank will not be

29

Chapter 2
30 of 32

considered a swap dealer to the extent it offers to enter into a swap with a
customer in connection with originating a loan to that customer or its dealing
activities are less than a de minimis level established by the CFTC and the SEC.
6. “Security-Based Swap Dealer” – Any person who (i) holds itself out as a
dealer in security-based swaps; (ii) makes a market in security-based swaps; (iii)
regularly enters into security-based swaps with counterparties for its own account;
or (iv) engages in any activity causing the person to be commonly known as a
dealer or market maker in security-based swaps. Excludes an entity engaged in a
de minimis level of security-based swap dealing activity to be established by the
CFTC and SEC.
(See Proposed Rule, “Further Definition of ‘Swap Dealer,’ ‘Security-Based Swap
Dealer,’ ‘Major Swap Participant,’ ‘Major Security-Based Swap Participant,’ and
‘Eligible Contract Participant,’” CFTC and SEC, 75 Federal Register 80,174
(Dec. 21, 2010); Proposed Rule, “Further Definition of ‘Swap,’ ‘Security-Based
Swap,’ and ‘Security-Based Swap Agreement’; Mixed Swaps; Security-Based
Swap Agreement Recordkeeping,” CFTC and SEC, 76 Federal Register 29,818
(May 23, 2011))
D. Retail Foreign Exchange Transactions – Section 742
1. A U. S. financial institution may not enter into, or offer to enter into, certain
types of foreign exchange transactions described in section 2(c)(2)(B)(i)(I) of the
Commodity Exchange Act with a retail customer except under a rule or regulation
of a Federal regulatory agency allowing the transaction under such terms and
conditions as the Federal regulatory agency prescribes (a “retail forex rule”).
2. Section 2(c)(2)(B)(i)(I) includes “an agreement, contract, or transaction in
foreign currency that … is a contract of sale of a commodity for future delivery
(or an option on such a contract) or an option (other than an option executed or
traded on a national securities exchange registered pursuant to section 6(a) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78f(a)).” A Federal regulatory
agency’s retail forex rule must treat similarly all such futures and options and all
agreements, contracts, or transactions that are functionally or economically
similar to such futures and options. (See Proposed Rule, “Retail Foreign
Exchange Transactions,” FRB, 76 Federal Register 46,652 (Aug. 3, 2011); Final
Rule, “Retail Foreign Exchange Transactions,” OCC, 75 Federal Register 41,375
(Jul. 14, 2011); Final Rule, “Retail Foreign Exchange Transactions,” FDIC, 76
Federal Register 40,779 (Jul., 2011))
VII. Public Company Issues
A. Compensation – Sections 951 to 953
1. “Say-on-Pay” – All pubic companies must give shareholders a non-binding
vote to approve executive compensation at least once every three years. At least
once every six years, shareholders must be given the opportunity to vote on how

30

Chapter 2
31 of 32

often they want to vote on executive compensation – every one, two or three
years. Applies to first annual meeting at least six months after July 21, 2010.
(§ 951)
2. Golden Parachute Compensation – Proxy solicitation material for a business
combination must clearly describe compensation to be paid to named executive
officers as a result of the transaction. Unless previously approved under a “sayon-pay” vote, golden parachute compensation must be subject to a non-binding
shareholder vote at the time the transaction is approved. (§ 951)
3. Compensation Committee Independence – Listed companies must have a
compensation committee that meets independence requirements similar to those
for audit committees under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Directors who receive
consulting, advisory or other compensatory fees or who are affiliates of the
company will not be independent. The SEC has one year to adopt rules to address

FDIC as Receiver of Heritage Community Bank v. Saphir, et al., Filed Nov. 1,
2010
FDIC Files Lawsuit Against Directors and Officers of Failed Illinois Bank
Wednesday, November 3, 2010
Written by Bard Brockman
The FDIC filed a lawsuit against directors and officers of Heritage Community
Bank (Glenwood, Ill.), which was taken into FDIC receivership in early February 2009.
The FDIC lawsuit was filed in federal court in Chicago on November 1, 2010, and it is
the FDIC’s second suit against directors or officers of failed institutions since the advent
of the current real estate recession. For a copy of the complaint, click here.
The FDIC’s case theory revolves around the bank’s commercial real estate
(“CRE”) lending program. The lawsuit alleges that the directors and officers failed to
protect the bank from the “substantial inherent risks of large-scale CRE lending,” by:
•

routinely financing CRE projects without any meaningful analysis or adequate
appraisals;

•

repeatedly making loans with excessive loan-to-value ratios; and

•

failing to properly evaluate the creditworthiness of CRE borrowers and
guarantors.

One unique factual allegation in the lawsuit is that the bank routinely drew down
interest reserves from specific loans and recorded it as income. That practice, the FDIC
alleged, generated phony profits, which the bank used to justify “substantial dividends”
to the holding company and “generous incentive compensation” to its senior
management.

The lawsuit asserts three distinct sets of claims – one set against the bank’s
directors; a second set against the directors and officers on the bank’s loan committee;
and a third set against the bank’s chief financial officer.
Claims Against Directors
The FDIC alleged that the directors had breached their duties under both federal
law (FIRREA) and state law by:
•

failing to establish and enforce lending policies, including limits on CRE
concentrations and limits on speculative or high-LTV projects;

•

failing to establish sufficient reserves for loan losses and maintaining
adequate capital; and

•

failing to ensure that the bank had sufficient, capable personnel to undertake
and administer the CRE lending program.

Claims Against Directors and Officers on Loan Committee
The FDIC similarly alleged that the members of the loan committee had violated
FIRREA and state law duties by:
•

failing to enforce prudent lending policies;

•

failing to make informed decisions about loans they approved; and

•

failing to ensure that approved loans were properly monitored.

Claims Against Chief Financial Officer
The FDIC alleged that the bank’s CFO was grossly negligent (in violation of
FIRREA), was negligent under state law, and breached his fiduciary duties to the bank
under state law, by:
•

failing to ensure that the bank’s ALLL reserves were sufficient in the face of
negative indicators, including an increasing number of distressed CRE
credits;

•

failing to ensure that the bank maintained sufficient capital to cushion against
high-risk CRE loan losses; and

•

improperly advising the board to approve dividends to the holding company
and incentive compensation awards to senior management.

This lawsuit against the directors and officers of Heritage Community Bank is
expected to start a small wave of D&O suits. The FDIC recently announced that it
expects to file actions against 70 directors and officers of failed institutions. More suits
are certainly on the way, and we will continue to update BankBryanCave.com with
additional D&O litigation information.

Chapter 3
4 of 37

The FDIC filed its third lawsuit against selected former directors and officers of a
failed financial institution on January 14, 2010. The defendants in the lawsuit are
certain former directors and officers of Integrity Bank (Alpharetta, Ga.), which the FDIC
placed into receivership on August 29, 2008. The complaint, which was filed in the U.S.
District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, asserts claims for negligence, gross
negligence and breach of fiduciary duty.
The central theme of the complaint is that the defendants served on the bank’s
Director Loan Committee, and in that capacity they pursued an “unsustainable growth
strategy designed to exploit the then-expanding ‘bubble’ in the residential and
commercial real estate market.” Directors who did not serve on that committee were not
sued. The FDIC alleged a variety of misdeeds by the defendants, including the following:
•

the adoption of a loan policy that set a lending limit in excess of the statutory
legal lending limit;

•

the abdication of the credit and lending functions to a Senior Lender who was
compensated based on the volume of loan originations, without regard to the
quality of the credit; and

•

an over-concentration in speculative ADC loans that ultimately represented
nearly 80% of the bank’s total loan portfolio

However, the more than $70 million in damages alleged focus on twenty-one (21)
specific ADC loans approved by, or subject to the oversight of, the Director Loan
Committee.

There are three interesting side notes that are not apparent from a reading of the
FDIC’s complaint. First, in April 2010, federal prosecutors indicted two former
executives of Integrity Bank (including one of the director defendants in the FDIC civil
suit) on charges of conspiracy, bribery, bank fraud and securities fraud. In public
statements following the indictments, the prosecutors alleged that these executives had
conspired with a major borrower to essentially “rob the bank from the inside.” However,
the losses alleged in the Complaint do not involve the borrower involved in the fraud
loses. It will be interesting to see if the other director defendants point to that alleged
criminal conduct as the true proximate cause of the bank’s failure.
The second notable item is that one of the former Integrity Bank directors sued
by the FDIC, Jack S. Murphy, is the current chairman of the Georgia Senate Banking
Committee. It does not appear that Sen. Murphy has any plans to resign his
chairmanship, and he has received strong public support from fellow Republicans in the
Georgia Senate.
The third item worth noting is that while there are numerous allegations of
negligence, it is alleged that virtually every specific loan involved a loan to one borrower
or specific loan to value limitation.

Chapter 3
6 of 37

On January 14, 2010, the FDIC filed its fourth lawsuit against former directors
and officers of a failed financial institution. The defendants in this action are the former
directors and the former VP of Real Estate Construction for 1st Centennial Bank
(Redlands, Cal.), which was put into receivership on January 23, 2009.
The FDIC’s complaint asserts state law claims for negligence, breach of fiduciary
duty, and breach of the directors’ duty to supervise. It also asserts a claim under
FIRREA for gross negligence. The complaint focuses on 16 specific loan losses, and it
seeks damages in the minimum amount of $26.8 million flowing from those bad loans.
The crux of the FDIC’s lawsuit is that the 1st Centennial defendants “recklessly
implemented an unsustainable business model pursuing rapid asset growth
concentrated in high-risk loans in commercial real estate without having adequate credit
administration and loan underwriting policies and practices to manage the risk.” Even
after the local real estate market had softened significantly, the FDIC alleged, the
defendants did not take steps to curtail the bank’s lending , carefully monitor the
existing loan portfolio, or seek to minimize loan losses. By the end of 2008, the
percentage of Acquisition, Development and Construction loans to total capital had
increased to 1,264%, more than ten times the regulatory guidance.
Another central theme of the FDIC’s lawsuit is that the bank’s CEO, Chief Credit
Officer and VP of Real Estate Construction were all unqualified to carry out their duties
and responsibilities to the bank. This does not necessarily present the other director
defendants with a defense, however, as the FDIC has specifically alleged the board did
not adequately supervise the bank’s management.

FDIC as Receiver of Corn Belt Bank and Trust Company v. Stark, et al., Filed
Mar. 1, 2011
FDIC Sues Former Directors and Officers of Corn Belt Bank & Trust
Tuesday, March 22, 2011
Written by Bard Brockman
The FDIC filed its fifth lawsuit against former officers of directors of a failed
banking institution on March 1, 2011. The defendants are four members of the Loan
Committee for Corn Belt Bank & Trust (Pittsfield, Illinois). Three of the defendants were
directors (one of whom as bank president), and the fourth defendant was Corn Belt’s
Senior VP of Lending. See a copy of the FDIC’s complaint.
The FDIC seeks to recover damages for five failed loans to borrowers in the truck
leasing business. According to the FDIC’s complaint, Corn Belt’s internal loan review
specifically warned the defendants about the following weaknesses in the loans: (i) they
provided 100% financing to a start-up company; (ii) the borrower was outside the
bank’s geographical footprint; (iii) the loans would be secured by semi-tractors and
other rolling stock; and (iv) the guarantees covered only a small portion of the debt. The
FDIC also alleges that the defendants knew or should have known that: (i) the loan
terms did not require the borrower to make an equity contribution; (ii) the borrower
had inadequate cash flow; (iii) the debt service coverage ratios were insufficient; (iv) the
credit request relied only on forward-looking financial statements; and (v) the loans
allowed the borrower to make draws in excess of the amount required to purchase semitractors.

Among the noteworthy allegations in the FDIC’s complaint is that the president
and chief lending officer closed a $1.8 million loan, despite the fact that it had not been
approved by the Loan Committee. The FDIC is equally critical of the Loan Committee on
this extension of credit. Once the Loan Committee learned that the loan had been
closed, the FDIC alleges, it did not object or question the officers who had extended the
unauthorized credit.
The FDIC asserted claims against all defendants for negligence (under Illinois
law) and gross negligence (under FIRREA) for approving the failed loans, which the
FDIC contends resulted in loan losses to Corn Belt of approximately $10.4 million. The
FDIC asserted similar claims against the former president and chief lending officer for
making the unauthorized loan, and for failing to properly administer loans and protect
the bank’s security interest in collateral.
This is the FDIC’s first lawsuit that focuses on commercial lending practices
outside of the real estate arena, and it serves to put the banking community on notice
that the FDIC is not singularly focused on failed real estate loans.

FDIC Sues Three Former Washington Mutual Executives and Their Wives

On March 16, 2011, the FDIC brought suit in the United States District Court in
Seattle against three top executives of the failed Washington Mutual Bank, alleging that

those executives’ “gross negligence and breaches of fiduciary duty” caused WaMu to lose
“billions of dollars.” In a further sign that the FDIC intends to be aggressive in such
matters, the FDIC named as defendants two of the executives’ wives, alleging that they
improperly received transfers of property before and after WaMu’s September 2008
failure.
The lawsuit represents the sixth lawsuit to date filed by the FDIC against former
directors and/or officers of failed banks following the recent economic downturn. It is
significant because WaMu represented the largest bank failure in U.S. history, with
assets that stood at more than $300 billion dollars when it failed.
The complaint does not set a specific amount of damages sought, but the
damages could well exceed $900 million. The complaint generally alleges that the
executives focused on short term gains to increase their own compensation, and
disregarded the best interests of the institution for the longer term. Specifically, the
complaint alleges that the bank’s home loans division recklessly made billions of dollars
of loans which were highly risky, single family residential loans, which dramatically
heightened the risk profile of the loans held in WaMu’s portfolio. The complaint alleges
that this high concentration in high risk residential loans, positioned the bank such that
it would be impossible for it to survive what characterized as “the inevitable decline in
the overrated housing market.”
There have also been reports that the FDIC reached an agreement with WaMu’s
outside directors for a payment of $125 million to settle all potential claims. If these

reports are in fact accurate, it is interesting that the settlement amount was negotiated
and finalized without the initiation of any litigation.
Finally, the FDIC has made it clear that it will be pursuing more of these types of
claims. The FDIC’s Professional Liability Lawsuits page shows that the FDIC’s Board has
approved lawsuits against 158 individual directors and officers of failed banks, while
filed lawsuits only name 40 individual defendants so far. Thus, it would appear that far
more litigation is on the way.

FDIC as Receiver for Wheatland Bank v. Spangler, et al., Filed May 5, 2011
FDIC Sues Former Directors and Officers of Wheatland Bank
Thursday, May 19, 2011
Written by Bard Brockman
The FDIC filed its seventh D&O lawsuit since the beginning of the current
economic downturn. The complaint was filed against the former directors and officers of
Wheatland Bank of Naperville, Illinois. See a copy of the FDIC’s complaint.
The FDIC’s theory about the ultimate failure of Wheatland Bank has a ring of
familiarity to it by now. It contends that the bank pursued rapid asset growth
concentrated on high-risk commercial real estate (CRE) loans, without implementing
adequate loan underwriting and credit administration practices to manage the risk. The
FDIC also alleges that the bank routinely violated its loan policies, approved loans that
had little chance of repayment, and repeatedly ignored regulators’ warnings about its
risk lending practices.

Summary of FDIC D&O Litigation

Chapter 3
11 of 37

The complaint asserts two primary case theories. First, it alleges that the
members of the bank’s Loan Committee (which included two non-director officers)
approved high-risk insider loans to “favored shareholders or borrowers” without
adequate analysis or collateral, and failed to pursue the borrowers or guarantors after
those loans went into default. The FDIC asserts alternative claims against the Loan
Committee defendants for gross negligence (under FIRREA), negligence, breach of
fiduciary, and breach of loyalty for the more than $22 million of losses caused by eight
loan defaults.
Second, the FDIC asserts negligence and gross negligence claims against the
director defendants for their failure to properly supervise the operations of the bank.
Specifically, the FDIC alleges that the director defendants permitted management to
violate the bank’s business plan and loans policies; that they failed to select and retain
competent management; and that they failed to exercise independent judgment in
evaluating the actions and competency of management.
This second set of claims is perhaps the most intriguing. It signals that the FDIC
is not concentrating solely on the directors and officers who comprise the loan
committee. Instead, the FDIC will seek to hold directors liable for alleged breaches in
connection with their ultimate role in supervising the management and operations of
the bank.

Chapter 3
12 of 37

Monday, August 1, 2011
Written by Bard Brockman
On July 6, 2011, the FDIC filed a civil complaint against Michael Perry, the
former chief executive officer of IndyMac Bank, F.S.B. (“IndyMac”). A copy of the
complaint is available here. The lawsuit is the FDIC’s eighth lawsuit against directors or
officers of failed banks in the current economic downturn, and it comes a little more
than one year after its first D&O lawsuit (against four senior officers of IndyMac’s home
builders division).
In its complaint against Mr. Perry, the FDIC chronicles IndyMac’s meteoric rise
as an independent mortgage lender. For instance, between 2000 and 2006, IndyMac
increased its mortgage loan production from approximately $10 billion to almost $92
billion, most of which was sold in the secondary market. According to the complaint,
IndyMac’s principal mortgage product was a high-risk “Alt-A” loan, which was typically
marketed to borrowers with less than full documentation, lower credit scores and higher
loan-to-value ratios.
The crux of the FDIC’s complaint is that Mr. Perry neglected to comply with his
duties as CEO, and that he presided over IndyMac’s aggressive generation of residential
loans at a time when he knew the secondary market was volatile and uncertain. When
IndyMac could not profitably sell those loans in the secondary market, it transferred the
loans to its internal “Hold for Investment” portfolio. The mortgage loans generated in
the six-month period between April and October 2007 alone resulted in more than $600
million of liquidated losses for the bank. The FDIC believes that IndyMac suffered

Summary of FDIC D&O Litigation

Chapter 3
13 of 37

additional losses for loans generated in 2008, but it has not determined the amount of
those losses just yet.
To support its contention that Mr. Perry knew that the secondary market for
residential loans was rapidly deteriorating, the FDIC quotes from dozens of Mr. Perry’s
e-mails dating back to 2004. It also cites several unhelpful admissions that Mr. Perry
allegedly made in internal e-mails after the bursting of the real estate bubble (e.g., “we
were idiots, absolute idiots to allow ourselves to do 80/20 piggybacks at the tail end of a
long run in housing . . .”).
Before its failure, IndyMac grew to be the nation’s second largest mortgage lender
and the seventh largest S&L association. The FDIC seems determined to make many of
the key players at IndyMac answer for that very public failure.

estimates the failure of Haven Trust Bank will cost the Federal Deposit Insurance Fund
approximately $248 million. We have posted a copy of the complaint.

Chapter 3
14 of 37

Some of the core allegations in the FDIC’s complaint are very familiar by now.
The FDIC alleges that the Haven Trust defendants implemented an unsustainable
business model focused on rapid asset growth heavily concentrated in high-risk
commercial real estate (“CRE”) loans. It further contends that the defendants failed to
maintain adequate internal controls, loan underwriting policies, and sufficient credit
administration procedures necessary to oversee and manage the operations of the bank.
The FDIC alleges that the defendants continued to pursue an aggressive CRE lending
strategy throughout most of 2008, after regulators had cautioned them about the bank’s
poor asset quality and rapidly deteriorating capital ratios.
The unique allegations in the complaint center on the influence the FDIC
contends was exercised by two of the directors, R.C. Patel and Mike Patel, who
collectively owned a controlling interest in the bank. Specifically, the FDIC contends
that the bank made numerous imprudent insider loans (exceeding $7 million) to the
Patels or their relatives, all for the Patels’ personal benefit. The FDIC also alleges that
despite the bank’s rapidly declining capital-to-asset ratios, the defendant directors
authorized dividend payments to the bank holding company in the months prior to the
receivership.
The FDIC’s complaint asserts state law claims for negligence and breach of
fiduciary duty, and an additional claim for gross negligence under FIRREA. The total
amount of the damages sought is estimated to exceed $40 million.

FDIC Files Lawsuit Against Former Senior Loan Officer
Monday, October 10, 2011
Written by Bard Brockman
On August 8, 2011, the FDIC filed a lawsuit against Timothy J. Cuttle, the former
Senior Loan Officer of Michigan Heritage Bank, which was placed into receivership in
April 2009. A copy of the FDIC’s complaint is available here. Although the FDIC has
included loan officers among the defendants in some of its prior D&O lawsuits, this is
the first time in the current litigation cycle that the FDIC has targeted its claims against
a single loan officer.
The FDIC’s focus on the Senior Loan Officer is likely largely attributable to the
Bank’s detailed written Lending Policy, which assigned strict and specific
responsibilities to the Bank’s loan officers. According to the FDIC’s complaint, the
Senior Loan Officer violated the Lending Policy, as well as prudent lending practices, in
connection with eleven (11) commercial loans, which resulted in losses in excess of $8.2
million. The complaint asserts state law claims for negligence and breach of fiduciary
duty, and a gross negligence claim under FIRREA, for the following types of
misconduct:
•

causing the Bank to approve and fund loans based on inadequate collateral;

•

causing the Bank to approve and fund loans based on inadequate, incomplete,
in accurate or unrealistic appraisals;

•

failing to adequately inspect real estate taken as collateral;

Summary of FDIC D&O Litigation

Chapter 3
16 of 37

•

causing the Bank to approve and fund loans without requiring adequate
sources of repayment;

•

causing the Bank to approve and fund loans without adequately analyzing
debt service coverage ratios and the borrowers’ abilities to perform on the
loans;

•

failing to ensure that loans closed according to the terms approved; and

•

causing the Bank to approve and fund CRE loans in which the project equity
contribution from the borrower was not evaluated or was inadequate.

Although the FDIC targets the Senior Loan Officer, the lawsuit makes clear that
the loans at issue were approved by a Senior Loan Committee, and in a few instances, by
the Bank’s board of directors. So why has the FDIC seemingly departed from its prior
practice and not sued the Senior Loan Committee or the directors in this case?
The complaint offers clues to two possible explanations.
First, for many of the loans at issue, the FDIC alleges that the Senior Loan Officer
withheld key information from the Senior Loan Committee and the board, and that the
Bank would not have approved the loans had that information been disclosed.
Second, and perhaps more importantly, the complaint reveals that the Bank
eventually demoted the officer and removed him from the Senior Loan Committee in
May 2007 – two years before the Bank’s failure. He eventually left the Bank’s employ.
That affirmative disciplinary action may have spared the Senior Loan Committee and
the board of directors from being named as co-defendants in the lawsuit.

FDIC as Receiver of The Columbian Bank and Trust Co. v. McCaffree, Filed
Aug. 9, 2011
FDIC Sues Directors of Columbian Bank and Trust
Tuesday, October 11, 2011
Written by Bard Brockman
In the second of three D&O lawsuits filed on successive days in August, the FDIC
sued six former directors of Columbian Bank and Trust (Topeka, KS), which was placed
into receivership in August 2008. A copy of the FDIC’s complaint is available here.
The FDIC’s complaint alleges that Columbian embarked on an aggressive
commercial and CRE lending program in 2003 to drive up the Bank’s revenues. In
furtherance of this lending program, the FDIC contends, Columbian incentivized its
loan officers to generate loans, at the expense of credit quality. The FDIC further alleges
that this “uncontrolled” lending campaign, combined with the defendants’ several other
failures — most notably, the failure to heed regulators’ warnings and to follow the
Bank’s own loan policies – caused the 40-year-old Columbian Bank to collapse in just
five years.
The complaint focuses on losses resulting from loans to twelve sets of borrowers.
The FDIC is seeking to hold the former directors for the total amount of those loan
losses, which is over $52 million.
Aside from the FDIC’s contention that the loans at issue violated the Bank’s loan
policy and were the product of a negligent underwriting and approval process, the loans
bear few common characteristics. In one example, the FDIC alleges that Columbian

rehab a commercial office building in Kansas City that had no signed leases or tenants.
Columbian apparently never prepared a DSC or cash flow analysis on the project; nor
did it obtain financial statements on the borrower or its guarantors. The project failed,
and the Bank ultimately suffered losses of nearly $8 million.
The FDIC’s complaint presents two case theories: (1) that the defendants were
negligent and/or breached their fiduciary duty with respect to approval of the failed
loans; and (2) that the defendants were negligent and/or breached their fiduciary duty
in connection with their failure to properly supervise the Bank’s officers and employees.
These two case theories are presented in the context of claims for gross negligence
(under FIRREA), negligence under state law, and breach of fiduciary duty under state
law.
Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the FDIC’s complaint is the allegation that
the six defendants, along with “other culpable former directors,” constituted a majority
of the Bank’s board. This clearly suggests that the FDIC has elected not to sue all of the
former Columbian directors, despite its assertion that they are “culpable” for the Bank’s
failure.
Why the FDIC has chosen not to sue other former directors of Columbian is not
clear from the complaint. One possible explanation is that the defendant directors all
served on the Director’s Loan Committee and that the other former directors did not.
This does not seem plausible, however, since Columbian’s own loan policy invests
ultimate responsible for all lending activities with the full board. Other possible

explanations could be that the non-defendant directors did not vote for the loan loss
transactions at issue in the complaint, or that they voiced concern with Columbian’s
aggressive lending strategy. Regardless of the reason they were omitted from the
complaint, we view this as an encouraging sign that the FDIC will not automatically seek
to attach liability to any and every person who served as a director of a failed banking
institution.

FDIC as Receiver for Cooperative Bank v. Rippy, Filed Aug. 10, 2011
FDIC Sues Former Directors and Officers of Cooperative Bank
Wednesday, October 12, 2011
Written by Bard Brockman
On August 10, 2011, the FDIC sued nine former directors and officers of
Cooperative Bank (Wilmington, NC), which was placed into receivership in June 2009.
A copy of the FDIC’s complaint is available here.
In its complaint, the FDIC alleges that the board and senior management of
Cooperative Bank instituted a strategy in 2001 to grow from the Bank’s assets from
$443 million to $1 billion by the end of 2005. The Bank did not meet that goal, but the
board and senior management reaffirmed the goal to become a $1 billion bank, and
pursued an aggressive growth plan in furtherance of that goal. That aggressive growth
plan, the FDIC alleges, caused the Bank to become over-concentrated in acquisition,
development and construction (“ADC”) loans. Furthermore, the FDIC contends, the
defendants “failed to manage the inherent risks associated” with the aggressive growth
strategy. Specifically, the director defendants permitted a lax loan approval process that

Chapter 3
20 of 37

did not include a formal loan committee to review an analyze loans; instead, the Bank
relied on various levels of loan approval authority, which were routinely violated. State
and federal regulators repeatedly warned Cooperative’s management about the risks
associated with its high concentration in speculative loans and weaknesses in its lending
function, but the FDIC states those warnings were ignored.
The FDIC’s complaint seeks approximately $34.5 million of damages on
negligence and breach of fiduciary duty theories. The alleged damages flow from two
types of loan losses.
The first set of losses resulted from Cooperative’s “Lot Loan Program,” in which
the Bank provided credit to borrowers to buy vacant lots for the purported purpose of
eventually building vacation homes in developments along the North Carolina coast. In
reality, the FDIC alleges, Cooperative provided lot loans to out-of-state, speculative
buyers (many of whom intended to “flip” the lots) on artificially-inflated appraisals.
The Lot Loan program was particularly ill-advised, the FDIC contends, because
the Bank’s senior management acknowledged from the start that the lot loans would not
be profitable for the Bank. The senior managers viewed the Lot Loan Program as a “loss
leader,” which would put the Bank in a better position to provide construction financing
when the buyers were ready to build.
In the course of setting up the Lot Loan Program, the Bank’s senior management
represented to the Bank’s ALCO Committee that the lot loans would be limited to a 90%
loan-to-value ratio, and that payments would not be interest-only (which had been a
concern of the regulators). Even at 90% LTV, the lot loans violated the Bank’s own Loan

- 20 -

Chapter 3
21 of 37

Policy, which allowed only a 65% LTV limit for raw land and a 75% LTV limit for land
development. To make matters worse, the lot loans were no-equity loans, with interestonly payments, and the majority of the lot loans were “stated income” (no-document)
loans.
Cooperative’s board learned about the high-risk Lot Loan Program at a board
meeting on July 17, 2007, and specifically determined that the lot loans did not comply
with the Bank’s Loan Policy. Nevertheless, the board took no corrective action, and the
Bank continued to make risk lot loans for several more months. The FDIC is seeking to
recover damages of nearly $10 million against the Bank’s senior management – the
president and EVP for mortgage lending – for the lot loans extended before the July 17,
2007 board meeting. It is also seeking to hold the senior managers and all of the
directors liable for approximately $4.5 million of losses on lot loans extended after that
July 17, 2007 board meeting.
In addition, the FDIC is seeking to damages of over $20 million for losses
suffered on nine commercial real estate loans. The key allegations with respect to these
losses is that the director defendants approved these loans without any formal loan
review or evaluation process. Instead, the Bank’s president called individual directors
and secured telephonic approval until he had enough votes to approve a loan. The
director defendants did not have copies of the loan files or any other presentations to
evaluate the loan when they purportedly approved them by telephone.

FDIC as Receiver for Silverton National Bank, N.A. v. Bryan, Filed Aug. 22,
2011
FDIC Sues Directors and Officers of Silverton Bank
Wednesday, September 14, 2011
Written by Bard Brockman and Rob Klingler
On August 22, 2011, the FDIC filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the
Northern District of Georgia against the former directors and executive officers of
Silverton Bank, N.A. Silverton was declared insolvent and placed into FDIC receivership
on May 1, 2009.
Silverton, formerly known as The Banker’s Bank, was not a traditional banking
institution. It provided correspondent and clearinghouse services, among other financial
services, to community banks only. Silverton was owned by investor banks, and its
board was comprised entirely of experienced community bankers.
The FDIC’s account of Silverton’s failure contains many of the same hallmark
allegations present in its prior D&O lawsuits:
•

overly-aggressive growth goals;

•

compensation that incentivized loan production regardless of asset quality;

•

expansion of lending into unfamiliar geographic markets;

•

heavy focus on risky CRE and ADC lending;

•

significant weaknesses in loan underwriting and credit administration;

•

ignored warnings from state and federal banking regulators; and

•

complete disregard of deteriorating economic conditions.

As it has done in prior lawsuits, the FDIC has identified several failed credit
transactions that it contends are examples of negligence, gross and a breach of fiduciary
duty by the directors or officers who approved them. In total, the FDIC seeks damages in
excess of $61 million for fifteen (15) specific credit transactions.
Although it contains some familiar allegations and case themes, the FDIC’s
complaint against the Silverton D&Os is unique, both in substance and tone. For the
first time in the current downturn, the FDIC seeks to hold directors liable for instances
of what it describes as “corporate waste.” Specifically, the complaint recites several
examples of Silverton’s “extravagant spending” while the economy was in decline,
including: (i) the purchase of two corporate aircraft for the bank holding company; (ii)
the construction of a new airplane hangar for the holding company on leased property;
(iii) the construction of a “lavish” new office building, which Silverton occupied 20
months before the expiration of its then-current lease. The FDIC alleges that the
directors who authorized these specific expenditures are liable for more than $10
million of “corporate waste.”
The tenor of the FDIC’s allegations against the Silverton D&Os is more strident
than in its prior lawsuits. The FDIC is particularly critical of the Silverton board, which
was comprised of CEOs or presidents of other community banks. That experience and
specialized knowledge, the FDIC contends, imposed a heightened duty on the directors
to discharge the duties owed to the bank.
Bryan Cave banking partner Walt Moeling, who represented Silverton in
connection with certain regulatory matters, has a different perspective on the immediate

Chapter 3

cause of Silverton’s failure. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution interviewed Walt about
Silverton’s failure. Here is an excerpt from that article:
Ultimately, Moeling said, Silverton failed not because of its lending or spending,
but because it is structured differently than most banks.
As a bank for banks, Silverton’s services included clearing checks, offering shortterm investments for banks’ cash, financing new bank startups and divvying up
and selling parts of loans – known as “participations” – that were too large for
any single bank to handle.
To fund its operations, Moeling said, Silverton depended on member banks’ cash
deposits in their check-clearing accounts and short-term investments. For each
member, those accounts often totaled millions of dollars – well above the FDIC’s
deposit guarantee of $250,000.
When rumors of Silverton’s troubles surfaced in early 2009, a modern-day run
on the bank occurred. Member banks pulled out their money and turned to the
Federal Reserve to clear their checks and hold their cash.
“Once the cracks began to appear, the member banks felt that they couldn’t have
uninsured deposits,” Moeling said. Silverton “went from very liquid to out of
cash, very, very fast.”
Finally, the FDIC’s complaint is also unique in that it includes a direct claim
against the primary and excess D&O insurance carriers. The facts giving rise to that
claim are interesting. According to the complaint, Silverton paid the premium for a

primary D&O policy with Chubb. Chubb forwarded a Binder that referenced several
endorsements, including a Regulatory Exclusion, which would operate to exclude from
coverage any claims brought by federal or state regulators. However, when the D&O
Policy was issued about one month later, it did not include contain a Regulatory
Exclusion endorsement. One month later, on the very afternoon that Silverton was
closed and the FDIC was appointed as receiver, Chubb’s underwriting officer forwarded
the Regulatory Exclusion, which he claimed had been omitted from the policy in error.
When the FDIC later asserted a civil demand under the D&O policy, Chubb denied
coverage due to the Regulatory Exclusion. As part of its complaint, the FDIC is asserting
a claim for declaratory relief against Chubb and the excess carrier, Westchester, to have
the court determine whether the Regulatory Exclusion is part of the D&O policies.

FDIC as Receiver for First National Bank of Nevada v. Dorris, Filed Aug. 23,
2011
Recent Settlement Indicates FDIC’s Focus on D&O Insurance
Monday, October 10, 2011
Written by Jake Bielema
A recent negotiated settlement in an FDIC failed bank lawsuit, which has as its
sole focus potentially available funds under a D&O policy, and in fact assigns claims
under that policy to the FDIC, further suggests that the FDIC’s real focus in failed bank
litigation is on proceeds that may be available under D&O policies, as opposed to the
personal assets of former directors and former officers.
The First National Bank of Nevada (“FNB Nevada”) failed on July 25, 2008, less
than thirty days after First National Bank of Arizona (“FNB Arizona”) was merged with

an into FNB Nevada. On August 23, 2011, the FDIC filed an action in the District of
Arizona against the former CEO and Vice Chairman of the Bank’s holding company as
well as of both FNB Nevada and FNB Arizona and additionally against the holding
company’s Executive Vice President (“EVP”), who was also the EVP of FNB Nevada and
FNB Arizona. There was nothing remarkable about the FDIC’s complaint, which
basically alleged negligence and gross negligence in lending, primarily at FNB Arizona,
which allegedly resulted in millions of dollars of bad loans that ultimately contributed to
the Bank’s failure.
What is remarkable about the FNB Nevada case is that shortly after the
complaint was filed, on September 2, 2011, the FDIC and the two named defendants
jointly filed a Motion for Entry of Judgment which would in effect settle all of the FDIC’s
claims against the two named defendants. In the proposed settlement contemplated by
the Motion for Entry of Judgment, each of the individuals consented to the entry against
them of separate judgments in the amount of $20 million. Notably, however, those
amounts were to be paid only through what the FDIC is able to recover from the D&O
carrier, Catlin, which had denied coverage and refused to defend the FDIC’s claims on
behalf of the named defendants. The settlement specifically provides that the FDIC will
not pursue any aspect of the judgment against the named defendants individually, and
will limit its efforts at recovery to its claims for wrongful denial of coverage against the
D&O carrier.
This settlement no doubt had some appeal to the two named defendants, in that
it, if approved, it will result in a full release of any and all claims against them

individually, as well as an agreement not to pursue any aspect of the agreed upon
judgment from them individually. However, the insurance company is likely to take the
position that the settlement, which was entered into without development of any actual
evidence or proof that either of the named defendants engaged in any kind of actionable
wrong-doing, was collusive and was entered into without any rational analysis, and
solely at the expense of the carrier. The response to that, however, is likely to be that the
D&O carrier should not now be heard to criticize the manner and extent to which the
FDIC’s claims were analyzed or defended, after it refused to provide any coverage under
the policy or to provide any defense to the named defendants.
In any event, it is yet another indication that the FDIC’s primary focus in the
failed bank litigation is the proceeds of directors and officer liability policies, not the
personal assets of former officers and directors of failed institutions.

FDIC as Receiver for Alpha Bank v. Blackwell, Filed Oct. 7, 2011
FDIC Sues Former Directors and Officers of Alpha Bank & Trust
Wednesday, October 12, 2011
Written by Bard Brockman
On October 7, 2011, the FDIC filed a complaint against the former directors and
senior officers of Alpha Bank & Trust (Alpharetta, Ga.), which was put into receivership
on October 24, 2008. A copy of the FDIC’s complaint is available here. Alpha Bank &
Trust (“Alpha” or the “Bank”) opened in May 2006 and operated for only thirty (30)
months. Nevertheless, the FDIC estimates that the failure of Alpha will cause the
Deposit Insurance Fund to lose $214.5 million.

Summary of FDIC D&O Litigation

Chapter 3
28 of 37

According to the complaint, Alpha embarked on an aggressive growth strategy
that focused on making risky loans in the acquisition, development and construction
(“ADC”) and commercial real estate (“CRE”) sectors. The complaint also alleges that the
Bank incentivized loans officers to generate loans, regardless of credit quality or loan
performance, and that the Bank either disregarded or rejected warnings from regulators
and third-party loan review consultants.
The complaint seeks to recover $23.92 million in damages directly tied to losses
suffered on thirteen separate bad credits. The defendants were all members of the
Director’s Loan Committee, and according to the complaint, they each voted to approve
one or more of the subject loans. Their alleged failures and omissions included the
following:
•

failure to follow the Bank’s existing loan policies;

•

failure to inform themselves and each other about the true nature and
condition of the Bank’s loan portfolio;

•

failure to adopt and enforce prudent underwriting procedures and
appropriate loan-to-value ratios;

•

approving loans to borrowers who were or who should have been known to be
not creditworthy;

•

approving loans to be made on an unsecured or under-secured basis;

•

approving loans made on the basis of inadequate or non-existent appraisals;

•

causing or permitting loans to be made without properly and promptly
perfecting security interests in the loan collateral; and

•

failure to exercise their duties to manage and supervise the affairs of the Bank
in a safe, sound and prudent manner.

The complaint asserts a state law claim for negligence and a claim for gross
negligence under FIRREA. Interestingly, the FDIC does not assert a separate state law
claim for breach of fiduciary duty, even though it has consistently pled that claim in
nearly every other D&O lawsuit to date.

FDIC as Receiver for Mutual Bank v. Mahajan, Filed Oct. 25, 2011
FDIC Sues Former Directors, Officers and Outside Counsel of Mutual Bank
Friday, November 11, 2011
Written by Bard Brockman
The FDIC sued the former directors and two former officers of Mutual Bank
(Homewood, Illinois), along with Mutual Bank’s outside law firm, on October 25, 2011.
Mutual Bank was placed into FDIC receivership in July 2009, and its failure currently is
estimated to cost the Deposit Insurance Fund $775 million. A copy of the FDIC’s
complaint is available here.
One of the unique aspects of this lawsuit is the FDIC’s allegations of corporate
waste. For example, the FDIC alleges that the directors approved a $250,000 payment
for sponsorship of a “bank function.” The bank function was actually the wedding of one
of the directors, who was also the chairman’s and principal shareholder’s son. In
another example, the FDIC alleges that the directors allowed $495,000 of Bank funds to

Chapter 3

be used to make payments to another director for his wife’s defense of a Medicare fraud
case. In yet another example, the FDIC alleges that the directors permitted roughly
$300,000 of Bank funds to be used to fund travel to an unnecessary directors’ meeting
in Monte Carlo. In total, the FDIC is seeking to recover at least $1.09 million from the
directors who approved the wasteful transactions.
The FDIC is also suing the directors for their approval of $10.5 million of illegal
dividend payments in 2007 and 2008, at a time when the Bank was hemorrhaging and
under severe regulatory criticism. The dividends were paid to the bank holding
company, which in turn paid them to the shareholders, with 95% of the dividends being
paid to the controlling family, which had four members on the Bank board.
The bulk of the FDIC’s complaint is devoted to its claims against the directors
and senior officer defendants for approval of twelve loans that resulted in losses of over
$115 million for the Bank. As a backdrop for those claims, the FDIC describes a litany of
the Bank’s operational deficiencies and failures, including: (i) a “dangerous”
concentration in CRE and ADC loans; (ii) a failure to maintain a proper credit
administration staff; (iii) an inappropriate reliance on outside mortgage brokers to
structure and facilitate large loans; (iv) a failure to establish procedures to ensure
compliance with the Bank’s loan policy and prudent lending practices; (v) an inability to
generate timely and accurate financial reports; (vi) a routine disregard of the Bank’s
loan policy; and (vii) an arrogant disregard of bank regulators and their criticisms.
Most of the bad loans were for purchase or refurbishing of existing hotel
properties, and most of them were made after the commercial real estate market had

started to decline and collateral values had plummeted. In one example, in February
2008, the director and officers defendants approved a loan for nearly $29 million to a
limited liability company to renovate a hotel in south Florida. Approximately $20
million of the loan was used to refinance a prior loan that was already in default. The
Bank disbursed the funds without first obtaining formal approval by the loan
committee. Furthermore, at the time of the loan, the borrower had not received the
required construction permits. The Bank failed to monitor the project, and it disbursed
construction draws on sham purchase orders. In the end, the FDIC alleges, the
estimated losses attributable to this loan are in excess of $16 million, plus interest.
Finally, the FDIC also asserts claims for legal malpractice, breach of fiduciary
duty, and aiding and abetting against the Bank’s primary outside counsel (who was also
a director) and his law firm. In short, the FDIC alleges the Bank’s lawyer was aware of
the regulators’ warnings about the Bank’s overconcentration in out-of-area projects; its
poor underwriting practices; its inability or unwillingness to monitor and control large
loans; and its overconcentration in the hotel industry. Despite that knowledge, the FDIC
alleges, the lawyer and his firm actively facilitated “massive” loans to developers that
they knew or should have known would inflict huge losses on the Bank. The FDIC also
alleges that the lawyer and his firm failed to counsel the Bank on the illegality of the
$10.5 million of dividend payments to the holding company. In total, the FDIC is
seeking $79 million in damages against the lawyer and his firm, plus a disgorgement of
the more than $3 million of legal fees paid to the firm between January 2007 and April
2009.

FDIC as Receiver for Westsound Bank v. Johnson, Filed Nov. 18, 2011
FDIC Sues Former Directors and Officers of Westsound Bank
Tuesday, January 24, 2012
Written by Bard Brockman
In mid-November 2011, the FDIC filed a complaint against eleven former
directors and officers of Westsound Bank (Bremerton, WA), which was closed in May
2009. The lawsuit is the FDIC’s seventeenth action against former D&Os of failed
banking institutions since the advent of the Great Recession. A copy of the FDIC’s
complaint is available here.
The FDIC’s core allegations resemble those asserted in its prior D&O lawsuits.
Specifically, it alleges that the Westsound board embarked on a “reckless” business
strategy focused on high-risk ADC and CRE lending. The FDIC further contends that the
board and the Directors Loan Committee (“DLC”): (i) failed to properly manage and
supervise the bank’s lending function; (ii) approved loans in violation of and without
regard to the bank’s loan policy; (iii) ignored regulators’ warnings about excessive loan
concentrations and lax oversight of the lending function; and (iv) approved additional
loans and loan renewals and advances to mask non-performing credits.
The FDIC seeks to recover damages in excess of $15 million on claims for gross
negligence (under FIRREA), and state law claims for negligence and breach of fiduciary
duty. Its alleged damages are tied to 35 specific credits, including seven ADC/CRE loans,
and seven other loans to insiders allegedly made without board approval in violation of
Reg. O.

The most interesting loan losses arise from 21 loans made to members of the local
Russian/Ukranian community. These loans were among 142 “fraudulent” loans
originated by a single loan officer, who the FDIC alleges colluded with a non-bank
employee, Aleksandr Kravchenko, to bring loans to the bank. According to the
complaint, Mr. Kravchenko frequently purchased properties, and then would find a
straw buyer to obtain the loan to buy the property and fund construction of a spec home.
Mr. Kravchenko, through his construction company, often received a “development fee”
of $10,000 – $15,000 from the loan proceeds, although no work was performed for the
fee.
The FDIC contends that, under the bank’s loan policy, these loans should have
been considered by the Directors’ Loan Committee (“DLC”). Instead, these loans were
approved through an automated (and easily manipulated) process reserved for loans
intended to be sold into the secondary market. Most of the loans provided 100%
financing, and many were based on stated-income or incomplete and questionable
financial information. Additionally, the appraisals used to support automated approval
were based upon an “as-built” valuation, even where the proposed borrower had not
submitted building plans. Furthermore, the loan officer who originated the loans earned
more than $1 million in commissions alone, including commissions on renewals of nonperforming loans, in less than two years. The FDIC alleges that regulators warned the
board that the bank’s lending function, and specifically the protocol that allowed the
loan officer to obtain approval of the questionable credits, was “malfunctioning.” It
further alleges that the board did not address the problem in a timely fashion, allowing

the loan officer to extend credit on the 21 “fraudulent” loans for which the FDIC is now

FDIC as Receiver for Bank of Asheville v. Greenwood, Filed Dec. 29, 2011
FDIC Files Suit Against Former Directors of The Bank of Asheville
Wednesday, January 25, 2012
Written by Jake Bielema
On December 29, 2011, the FDIC filed suit against seven former directors of the
Bank of Asheville in the Western District of North Carolina seeking to recover over $6.8
million in losses suffered by the bank prior to receivership. All of the directors named as
defendants were members of the bank’s Loan Committee, the committee responsible
“for the amplification, implementation and administration of the loan policy” and
“management of the lending function”. The Complaint cites 30 specific commercial real
estate and business loans approved by the defendants between June 26, 2007 and
December 24, 2009 as causing loss to the bank and those loans form the subject matter
of the Complaint. A copy of the FDIC’s complaint is available here.
In the Complaint, the FDIC as Receiver essentially cites the Bank’s rapid growth
strategy concentrated in what it characterizes as “higher risk, speculative commercial
real estate loans”. The Complaint alleges that the defendants had virtually no previous
banking or commercial real estate lending experience, failed to implement even the
most basic prudent lending controls, and neglected to adequately supervise
inexperienced and under qualified lending personnel. The complaint further alleges that
the defendants failed to heed warnings by State and Federal regulators as well as outside

auditors of the increasing risk associated with the bank’s highly concentrated
commercial real estate loan portfolio. The complaint alleges that once those risks began
to manifest themselves, the defendants “took actions that masked the bank’s mounting
problems” by approving additional loss loans and renewing and making additional
advances on other non-performing loans, as well as replenishing interest reserves which
allowed borrowers to pay interest with more borrowed funds.
The Asheville suit brings to 18 the total number of lawsuits the FDIC has now
filed against directors and/or officers of failed banks. What is most notable about the
complaint is the absence of any particularly compelling allegation of wrongdoing, such
as self dealing or personal enrichment, and the relatively small amount of the losses
sought. The Asheville suit appears to be the clearest example yet of a suit that is based
almost solely upon allegations of negligence relating to rapid growth and over
concentration in commercial real estate, a fact pattern that was prevalent at hundreds of
community banks during the real estate boom years. The Asheville suit may signify that
the FDIC is becoming more aggressive in deciding which bank failures merit lawsuits, or
it may signal that the FDIC believed it needed to file a lawsuit in order to get the
attention of a D&O carrier. Based on the number of lawsuits that the FDIC has
authorized, it is clear that there will be many more lawsuits to come against former
directors and officers of failed banks.

FDIC as Receiver for R-G Premier Bank of Puerto Rico v. Galán-Alvarez,
Filed Jan. 18, 2012
FDIC Sues Former Directors and Officers of R-G Premier Bank
Thursday, January 26, 2012
Written by Bard Brockman
On January 18, 2012, the FDIC filed a complaint against former directors and
officers of R-G Premier Bank of Puerto Rico, which was closed and put into receivership
on April 30, 2010. A copy of the FDIC’s complaint is available here.
The roots of R-G Premier’s failure, the FDIC contends, can be traced to the 2001
strategic decision to increase its commercial real estate lending. According to the
complaint, the board of directors appointed a new Chief Lending Officer, Victor Irizarry,
and it structured the Bank to give Irizarry ”free rein” to make commercial real estate
loans. Among the board’s alleged failings was its decision to give Irizarry supervisory
control of the Bank’s credit risk management department. This reporting structure, the
FDIC alleges, effectively squelched the credit risk personnel from voicing any concerns
about the underwriting of loans or creditworthiness of borrowers. Internal audits and
banking regulators both warned that the credit risk management function should be
segregated from the loan department, but the board ignored those warnings.
The FDIC further alleges that the board itself essentially turned a “blind eye” to
the Bank’s lending function. Specifically, the FDIC alleges that the board failed to
institute effective loan reviews, which in turn “undermined its own ability to monitor the
health and quality of its rapidly expanding commercial loan portfolio.” The board’s
failure to institute appropriate procedures and controls, combined with its resistance to

recommended reform, resulted in the Bank’s extension of over $350 million in loans
that a “prudent banker should have known would probably never be repaid.”
The FDIC asserts two claims for gross negligence against the D&O defendants.
First, it asserts a claim against the director defendants (except for the advisory
directors) for their grossly negligent failure to adequately supervise the Bank’s lending
function. And second, it alleges a claim for gross negligence arising from the approval of
risky and imprudent loans by the officers and directors, including the advisory directors
who voted for those loans. The FDIC prays for damages in excess of $257 million for
loan losses arising from 77 specific failed credits.

S 310-40-15-5

A restructuring of debt constitutes a
TDR if the creditor for economic or legal reasons
related to the debtor’s financial difficulties grants a
concession to the debtor that it would not
otherwise consider.

S

However, not all modifications of loan terms result in a TDR. If the
modified terms are consistent with market conditions and
representative of terms the borrow could obtain in the open market,
the restructured loan is not categorized as a TDR.

Chapter 3A
8 of 13

S If

a modification meets the definition of a TDR, it
also meets the definition of an impaired loan and
must be accounted for as such in accordance
with ASC 310-40 (FAS 114). Why?
S A loan is impaired when it is probable that a
creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due
according to the contractual term of the loan
agreement, which includes both the contractual
interest and principal payments.

S TDRs

are a current “Hot Topic” and microscopic
scrutiny by regulators and auditors.
S Regulatory criticism often includes the need for
improvement.
S Auditors

are responsible for obtaining an understanding
of the extent to which the company is modifying the
terms of loans and the nature of the modifications in
order to plan the audit; identifying the internal controls
that management has implemented to ensure that
TDRs are identified and accounted for as impaired
loans.

S When

evaluating whether a restructuring
constitutes a TDR, the creditor must separately
conclude that both of the following exist:
1) The creditor granted a concession
2) The debtor is experiencing financial difficulties

S The

guidance on a creditor’s evaluation of whether it
has granted a concession and provides examples
of financial difficulty.

Chapter 3A

S If

a debtor does not otherwise have access to
funds at a market rate for debt with similar
risk characteristics as the restructured debt,
the restructuring may indicate the creditor
has granted a concession.
Concession stems from an agreement between
the creditor and the debtor or is imposed by law or
court
Concession is granted when creditor attempts to
protect as much of its investment as possible

S Reduction

of the stated interest rate for the
remaining original life of the debt
S Extension of the maturity date or dates at a
stated interest rate lower than the current
market rate for new debt with similar risk
S Reduction of the face amount or maturity
amount of the debt as stated in the
agreement
S Reduction of accrued interest

Chapter 3A
11 of 13

SA

temporary or permanent increase in the contractual
interest rate does not preclude the restructuring from
being a TDR. The new interest rate (although higher)
may be considered a concession because the new rate
could still be below market for new debt with similar risk.
S However, a restructuring that results in a delay in
payment that is insignificant is not a concession. The
amendments include examples illustrating the
assessment of whether a restructuring ‘s delay is
insignificant.

S The

debtor is currently in payment default on any of
its debt, or it is probable the debtor will be in default
on any of its debt in the foreseeable future
S The debtor has declared or is in the process of
declaring bankruptcy
S The debtor’s cash flows will be insufficient to service
any of its debt in accordance with the contractual
terms of the existing agreement for the foreseeable
future

Chapter 3A
12 of 13

S “Generally

accepted accounting principles require
a creditor to measure loan impairment based on
the present value of expected future cash flows
discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate.
However, as a practical expedient, a creditor is
permitted to measure loan impairment based on a
loan’s observable market price, or the fair value of
the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.”

as TDRs certain receivables for which the ALL had previously been
measured under a general allowance for credit losses methodology.
Upon identifying those receivables as troubled debt restructurings,
Company X identified them as impaired under the guidance in
Section 310-10-35.

The amendments in ASU No. 2011-02 require prospective
application of the impairment measurement guidance in
Section 310-10-35 for those receivables newly identified as
impaired. At the end of the first interim period of adoption
(September 30, 2011), the recorded investment in
receivables for which the allowance for credit losses was
previously measured under a general allowance for credit
losses methodology and are now impaired under Section
310-10-35 was $58.8 million, and the allowance for credit
losses associated with those receivables, on the basis of a
current evaluation of loss, was $7.2 million.

GUARANTORS TO BANK:
-YOU MISLED US
In suit by lender against Guarantors, the Guarantors
claimed that they were fraudulently induced to sign the
Guaranties based on alleged statements made by a
loan officer about the creditworthiness of the borrower.
According to the Guarantors, the loan officer told them
the companyʼs two principals “were the Bank's strongest
borrowers,” “were loved at the Bank,” and “were good
people to do business with.” Guarantors pled a cause of
action based on fraud.

BANK TO GUARANTORS
-WE DONʼT BELIEVE YOU
ACTUALLY RELIED ON THAT
STATEMENT!
There existed no fiduciary relationship between the
bank and guarantors that would have obligated the
Bank to provide them with accurate advice. Absent a
special relationship there could be no reasonable
reliance on the loan officerʼs statement. Moreover,
where the statements in question involve general
commendations or opinion a party is obligated to make
their own investigation in order to ascertain the truth.

RESCISSION CONT.
Rescission is authorized where:

(iii) The borrower and lender have agreed to cancel the
sale based upon an enforceable promise by the
borrower to cure the default.

THE PRICE REAL
WAS TO GOOD TO BE TRUE
Decision One conducted a nonjudicial foreclosure sale at which
Warren Properties was the high bidder. Before leaving the courthouse
steps, Warren Properties paid the funds and Decision One gave a
receipt. Several weeks later, Decision One returned the funds to
Warren Properties purporting to rescind the sale. Warren Properties
demanded performance and sued alternatively for damages and
specific performance. Decision One defended that its calculation of the
opening bid had been a mistake and asked the court to invoke its
equitable power to grant relief. The trial court granted Warren
Propertiesʼ motion and ordered Decision One to deliver the deed.

FORECLOSURE PRICE CONT.
The Court of Appeals rejected Decision Oneʼs mistake
argument under the general rule that “equity does not
operate to rescind a contract based upon a unilateral
mistake ʻwhere the party claiming mistake, by exercising
reasonable diligence, could have discovered the truth.ʼ”

DUTY TO NEGOTIATE?
• Dubarton defaulted on its loan from Appalachian,
which began foreclosure proceedings. Dubarton,
alleging negligence and fraud, filed suit to enjoin the
foreclosure. The trial court denied relief. On appeal,
among other claims, Dubarton argued the fraudulent
failure by the bank to enter into another loan
agreement to fund satisfaction of the defaulted loan.

DUTY TO NEGOTIATE?
The Court of Appeals, rejected this contention. The
bank had the right under the security deed to
foreclose, rendering irrelevant any subsequent
actions by the bank that made more difficult the
debtorʼs repaying the loan. Held: the bank owed no
duty to the borrower to renegotiate the terms of the
loan or to enter into a problem loan workout.

PEANUT PRIORITY
Peanut growers were not paid by peanut broker. Lender
asserted priority claim to proceeds from the sale of the
peanuts. Growers requested that lenderʼs claim be
subordinated based upon bad faith. The absence of
good faith in the conduct of a secured party is a
consideration which, if sufficiently established by the
evidence, may result in a reordering of the priorities set
forth in the UCC.

PEANUTS CONT.
J.E. Golden Farms alleged that Fidelity told it that as
soon as its peanuts were delivered, Farm Credit would
issue a check for payment. J.E. Golden Farms
contacted Rick Bitner of Farm Credit in Tallahassee to
verify Fidelity's statement. Bitner allegedly confirmed
that Fidelity had a line of credit, that Fidelity's account
was in good standing, and that upon receipt of the
paperwork for the peanuts, Farm Credit would issue
payment directly to J.E. Golden Farms.

ASSIGNMENT IS NOT A
MYSTERY WORD
Beal Bank sued on a note and guaranty it acquired by
assignment from the FDIC acting as receiver for
BankFirst. The borrower and guarantors appealed from
an entry of summary judgment against them in the
amount of $6,977,750 arguing that there was no
evidence of a valid assignment.

11

Chapter 4
12 of 36

ASSIGNMENT CONT.
• Although the appellants concede that the affidavits
establish that the FDIC assigned the note to Beal
Bank, they claim that Beal Bank has not shown that
the assignment was valid because there is no
evidence that BankFirst had failed or that the FDIC
was appointed receiver of BankFirst.

ASSIGNMENT CONT.
• The evidence submitted includes an affidavit providing
that Beal Bank acquired the note and deed for
valuable consideration by assignment from the FDIC
as receiver of BankFirst; the written assignment of the
deed from the FDIC to Beal Bank, which repeatedly
identifies the FDIC as receiver for BankFirst; and a
Note Allonge attached to the promissory note,
identifying Beal Bank as the assignee and the FDIC
as receiver for BankFirst.

• Guarantors also argued that the individual guaranties
were not assigned along with the collateral
documents. Unfortunately for them the assignment of
the deed included all other loan documents relating to
the loan. Further, under Georgia law, the assignment
of the underlying promissory note operates as an
assignment of any related guaranty.

Sue or Foreclose
Borrower defaulted on over $4 million in loans and the
lender commenced foreclosure proceedings for an
August, 2008 sale. At the borrowerʼs request the
lender pulled the foreclosure ad to provide the
borrower with time to sell the property. The borrower
was unable to do and the lender, instead of
recommencing foreclosure, simply sued the borrower
and guarantors.

Sue or Foreclose
The value of the real property collateral dropped
dramatically after the foreclosure was called off. The
obligors argued that the lender should have been
required to have mitigate its damages by continuing
with the foreclosure in order to maximize its recovery
and reducing the amount of the deficiency.

Sue or Foreclose
“The fatal flaw in this argument is that the Bank had
no obligation to pursue foreclosure proceedings but
was fully authorized by both the law and the debt
instruments to pursue only lawsuits against the
debtors and guarantors to recover the debts.”

legal claims against its officers and directors for breach

SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS
The board explained that it created a special committee

interests of the Company would not be served by
commencing litigation.”

“On September 24, 2008, Mannato, in his capacity as a
shareholder of SunTrust, demanded access to SunTrust's books

two percent of SunTrust's shares and was therefore not entitled to
inspect its records and books under OCGA § 14–2–1602(e) and

SUMMARY ANSWER: A nonlawyer who answers for
a garnishee other than himself in a legal proceeding
pending with a Georgia court of record is engaged in
the unlicensed practice of law. Approved by the Ga Supreme Court
on September 12, 2011.

Garnishments Cont.
A properly served garnishee is bound to file an
answer with the appropriate court. If the answer is not
filed, the garnishee faces a default judgment. The
inescapable conclusion is that a garnishment action is
a legal proceeding. That being the case, the
Committee examines who is permitted to file an
answer to a legal proceeding that is pending with a
Georgia court.

Plaintiff alleged that Countrywide then used these false
property valuations to induce Plaintiffs and other
borrowers into ever-larger loans on increasingly risky
terms.” Mozilo purportedly knew “these loans were
unsustainable for Countrywide and the borrowers and to
a certainty would result in a crash that would destroy the
equity invested by Plaintiffs and other Countrywide
borrowers.”

26

Chapter 4
27 of 36

COUNTRYWIDE CONT
Mozilo and others at Countrywide then allegedly
“hatched a plan to ʻpoolʼ the foregoing mortgages and
sell the pools for inflated value. Rapidly, these two
intertwined schemes grew into a brazen plan to
disregard underwriting standards and fraudulently inflate
property values ... in order to take business from
legitimate mortgage providers, and moved on to
massive securities fraud hand-in-hand with concealment
from, and deception of, Plaintiffs and other mortgagees
on an unprecedented scale.”

COUNTRYWIDE CONT.
Countrywide had a duty to “disclose to each borrower,
including each Plaintiff herein, that the mortgage being
offered to the Plaintiff was, in fact, part of a massive fraud
that Countrywide knew would result in the loss of the equity
invested by Plaintiff in his home and in severe impairment
to Plaintiff's credit rating.” Countrywide's fraudulent scheme
“destroyed California home values county-by-county and
then State-wide.”

Chapter 4

COUNTRYWIDE CONT.
Court in dismissing claim found that even if the
allegations were true “..we conclude that while
Countrywide had a duty to refrain from committing fraud,
it had no independent duty to disclose to its borrowers
its alleged intent to defraud its investors by selling them
mortgage pools at inflated values.”

Paul v. Home Bank, 2011 WL
3443484 (Ind App 2011)

28

Chapter 4
29 of 36

Read the Loan Documents
Plaintiffs were party to two loans (the “Superior” and the
“Subordinate” loans) with separate guaranties.
Guarantors argued that the integration clause found in
the signed guaranties for the Superior Loan had an
integration clause that negated the Subordinate Loan
Guaranty.

Read the Loan Documents
“The Loan Documents constitute the complete and
exclusive statement of all agreements among Borrower,
Bank, and Guarantor. The Loan Documents replace and
supersede all prior written and oral agreements by and
among Borrower, Bank, and Guarantor and no
representation, warranty, condition, commitment, or
other statement will have any force or effect whatsoever
unless contained in the Loan Documents.”

29

Chapter 4
30 of 36

Read the Loan Documents
The Superior Loan guaranty referenced the loan
number for the Superior Loan. The Subordinate Loan
guaranty referenced the loan number for the
Subordinate Loan. Thus, the Superior Loan and the
Subordinate Loan were two entirely separate
contractual transactions, and the integration clause in
the Superior Guaranty integrated only those agreements
that were part of the negotiations directly leading to the
Superior Loan.

Read the Loan Documents
Guarantors remained liable for the Subordinate
Loan once the Superior Loan had been paid in
full.

Appellants cannot now complain because they failed

Bank of America v. Narula,
2011 WL 3209849 (Kan App
2011)

31

Chapter 4
32 of 36

FRAUD
BofA sought to foreclose on a commercial office
building. Borrowers counterclaimed for breach of
contract, fraud, breach of fiduciary duty and negligent
misrepresentation. The trial court awarded the Narulas
$793,997 in compensatory damages and $750,000 in
punitive damages against BofA.

FRAUD
The trial found that the Narulas had a long-standing,
close relationship with Bank of America. From 1993 until
May 2001, the Narulas' principal personal banker,
known as a “Relationship Manager,” was Charles
Wooten, a banker for Bank of America. He met with the
Narulas many times and gave them advice on various
personal and business financial matters such as working
capital lines of credit, management of accounts
receivable, creditworthiness of customers, and the
Narulas' investment accounts.

32

Chapter 4
33 of 36

FRAUD
The evidence showed that Bank of America handled
both the Narulas' business needs and their personal
investment funds. Bank of America repeatedly promoted
itself to the Narulas as their “Trusted Financial Advisor.”
Bank of America wanted the Narulas to rely on it for its
advice and counsel. The Narulas, for their part, relied
heavily on Bank of America as their “Trusted Financial
Advisor” in their personal and business affairs, and
Bank of America knew that the Narulas were relying on
them for financial advice.

FRAUD
In 1998, Promotional Resources, the Narulas' business,
was outgrowing its office space. Wooten, the BofA loan
officer, suggested to the Narulas that they should
consider constructing their own building. Wooten told
the Narulas that the building could be an important part
of their estate plan and could serve as a source of
income during their retirement. Wooten even suggested
the building site.

33

Chapter 4
34 of 36

FRAUD
The Narulas liked Wooten's idea but told him that they
had no experience in constructing a building or how to
finance it. Wooten explained that they should not worry
because Bank of America would hold their hand through
the entire process. Borrower said “fine” so long as the
permanent financing once the construction was finished
was on a fixed rate.

FRAUD
BofA sold the borrower a swap in order to fix the rate.
“The Swap Agreement was a nonnegotiable, lengthy,
pre-printed form in small print that was not shown to the
Narulas before signing nor was it explained to them
during closing…in his first personal visit to the Narulas
in August 2001, Bank of America Officer Dennis Nicely
concluded that the Narulas had no idea as to how the
Swap Agreement worked.”

34

Chapter 4
35 of 36

FRAUD
BofA required the borrower to sign various Modification
and Extension Agreements, one of which deleted the
bankʼs obligation to convert the construction loan to a
permanent loan. The borrower was unable to move the
loan and as a condition for another Modification the
Narulas were required to begin liquidating personal
assets. Eventually the bank demanded payment on the
loan as well as the termination fee on the swap which at
that point amounted to over $180,000.

FRAUD
The trial court concluded the Bank deceptively removed
the provision requiring the bank to make a Permanent
Loan to the Narulas under the Second Modification and
Extension Agreement. The trial court further found that
the Narulas had no idea what was meant by the
sentence, “Section 2.2 of the Loan Agreement is hereby
deleted in its entirety.” Section 2.2 of the Loan
Agreement dealt with Bank of America's obligation to
make the Permanent Loan.

Interpretative guidance – bank lawyers regularly seek interpretive
guidance from regulators with respect to applicable law, regulations
and policies.

Transaction applications and related discussions – bank lawyers
represent their clients in connection with applications to merge
banks, raise capital, open branches, etc. Such applications also
involve a continuous dialogue that often begins pre-filing and that
can extend on past closing.

Examination findings and relates issues – regulators regularly
examine banks and the findings of their exams and other related
issues are often discussed with bank counsel.

Enforcement actions – regulators in their supervisory capacity often
ask the banks they regulate to agree to various enforcement actions
or seek to have them involuntarily imposed. Bank lawyers negotiate
with the regulators with respect to such actions and represent the
banks in connection with their implementation.

Post-closing – when a bank closes, bank lawyers represent the
former officers and directors of banks in connection with post-closing
investigation and other legal matters.

The attorney-client privilege generally applies to banks just like it
does to any other corporation.

Meaning, banks may refuse the disclosure of confidential
communications with bank counsel.

The privilege is designed to foster frank, open, and uninhibited
discourse between attorney and client so that the client’s legal
needs are competently addressed.

The attorney-client privilege may be raised during any type of legal
proceeding, civil, criminal, or administrative, and at any time during
those proceedings, pre-trial, during trial, or post-trial.

Attorney-Client Privilege

Chapter 6





Prior to 2006, there was a conflict between the regulators’ desire for
full, unfettered access to all institution information and the banks’
desire to retain the attorney-client privilege with respect to
information that the banks provided to their regulators and that was
later sought by third parties.
As a result, in 2006, Congress passed 12 U.S.C. § 1828(x)(1) which
provides that there is no waiver of the attorney-client privilege, under
federal or state law, when a bank provides privileged materials to a
federal or state bank regulator.

Attorney-Client Privilege

Chapter 6
7 of 15







Section 1828(x)(1) clearly applies to the Federal Reserve, FDIC,
OCC and state regulators, like the Georgia Department of Banking &
Finance.
However, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is not a
“federal banking agency,” as defined in the statute, and thus not
expressly covered by it.
Nevertheless, pursuant to a January 4, 2012 CFPB bulletin, the
CFPB has taken the position that it can demand attorney-client
privileged documents from its supervised institutions without the
privilege being waived as to third parties.

Attorney-Client Privilege

9

Chapter 6
8 of 15

Issues can arise when a bank is closed because the privilege runs
with the bank.

Thus, when a bank goes into FDIC receivership, the FDIC succeeds
to the privilege and is able to waive it.

This is one of the main drivers for officers and directors retaining
personal counsel when failure becomes a risk. Their personal
counsel can advise them about personal liability and related issues.
If that is done, communications between those individuals and that
separate counsel will be privileged.

Attorney-Client Privilege

Pursuant to 12 C.F.R. Part 308, the federal banking regulators have
provided rules of procedure in administrative proceedings before
them. These rules include provisions that allow the FDIC and other
federal bank regulators to exclude and otherwise sanction lawyers.

Similar rules would apply in traditional courts for proceedings there
involving the federal banking regulators and any state regulatory
proceeding handled in such a forum.

There are no specific statutes or rules that would expressly permit
the exclusion or sanction of bank counsel outside of administrative
or litigation proceedings.

Payment Products
Three basic structures for payment products:
• Pay Later: Credit Cards; 30-day bill pay; lines of credit;
charge cards; payday lending
• Pay Now: Cash (though some say cash is also “pay
before”); checks; debit.
• Pay Before: Travelerʼs checks; money orders; tokens;
prepaid cards

Some are one-time transitory products that are thrown away when used up. Others allow for
reloading and longer term relationships.
Some are entirely anonymous. Others are imprinted with customer names and can be
renewed every 2-3 years
Some provide cash access at ATMs. Many do not allow for cash redemption.
Some are pre-denominated in fixed dollar amounts. Others are loaded with value up to the
level requested by the purchaser.

It is clear that prepaid cards provide an important and necessary source of financial
services to millions of underbanked and underserved consumers.

Prepaid Basics

Closed Loop vs Open Loop
Gift Cards
Closed Loop “Store Gift Cards”
• Essentially a plastic version of a paper gift certificate
• Issuer is the retailer that accepts the card
• Runs on merchantʼs POS system – clerk usually knows immediately
balance on card. There is NO Bank involved. (usually)
Open Loop “General Use Cards”
• Essentially a prepaid Visa, MasterCard, American Express or Discover
Card useable where each brand is accepted
• Runs on existing credit card POS system – clerk only knows if a purchase
is approved or declined; clerk does not know the balance.
• Can also access ATMs with a PIN
• There is ALWAYs a Bank involved (usually)

Open Loop – Branding
• Cards branded with a leading “acceptance
mark” (American Express, Discover, MasterCard,
Visa and PIN Networks such as NYCE, Star, Pulse,
Interlink, etc)
• Value is maintained on a host computer system
• Uses existing payment network infrastructure for ATM
and POS – anywhere network brand is accepted

device or vehicle).
– Prepaid program.
– Provider of prepaid access.
– Seller of prepaid access.

FinCENʼs Prepaid Access Rules
• FIRST, a program is NOT a covered “prepaid program” if it meets one
of these 3 GENERAL exemptions:
– Provides closed loop prepaid access to funds of up to $2,000
maximum value in any day; OR
– Provides prepaid access solely to funds provided by a federal, state,
local or other government agency; OR
– Provides prepaid access solely to funds from pre-tax flexible spending
arrangements for health and dependent care expenses, or from Health
Reimbursement Arrangements.
–
NOTE: Closed loop prepaid access is “[p]repaid access to funds or the
value of funds that can be used only for goods or services in transactions
involving a defined merchant or location (or set of locations), such as a
specific retailer or retail chain, a college campus, or a subway system.”

•

FinCENʼs Prepaid Access Rules
• SECOND, a program is NOT a covered “prepaid program” if it
meets one of these 2 LIMITED exemptions:
• Provides prepaid access solely to employment benefits, incentives,
wages or salaries; OR
• Provides “open loop” prepaid access solely to funds not to exceed
$1,000 maximum value, and from which no more than $1,000 can
be initially or subsequently loaded, used, or withdrawn on any day.
•
•
•
•

PROVIDED that it does not permit:
Funds or value to be transmitted internationally.
Transfers between or among users within the program.
Reloads from non-depository sources.

FinCENʼs Prepaid Access Rules
• A Provider is the participant within a prepaid program that agrees to serve
as the principal conduit for access to information from its fellow program
participants. The participants in each prepaid access program must
determine a single participant to serve as the provider of prepaid access.
• A Seller is any person that receives funds or the value of funds in
exchange for an initial or subsequent loading of prepaid access, if that
person:
• Sells prepaid access offered under a prepaid program that can be used
before verification of customer identification; OR
• Sells any prepaid access in excess of $10,000 to any person during any
one day, and has not implemented policies and procedures reasonably
adapted to prevent such a sale.

25

FinCENʼs Prepaid Access Rules

• Providers and Sellers are Money Services Businesses (MSBs).
They must establish procedures to:
• Obtain identifying information about a person who obtains prepaid
access under a prepaid program, and
• Verify the identity of that person.
• Identifying information includes: name, address, date of birth, and
identification number.
• Sellers must also establish procedures to obtain identifying
information about a person who obtains any kind(s) of prepaid
access to funds that exceeds $10,000 during any one day, and
verify that personʼs identity.

FinCENʼs Prepaid Access Rules

• Each Provider and Seller must also:
• Develop, implement and maintain an AML compliance
program.
• File reports of suspicious activity.
• Comply with reporting, recordkeeping and other rules
applicable to MSBs generally.
• In addition, Providers must also:
• Register as an MSB with FinCEN.
• Maintain access to transactional records.

27

FinCENʼs Prepaid Access Rules
• Bank Centered Programs:
• FinCEN FAQs have confirmed that “bank-centered programs,”
controlled by a bank issuer, are outside the scope of these
regulations. Regulations for banks and MSBs are “mutually
exclusive.”
• Difficult position for banks:
• Bank regulators want banks to be “in control.”
• Law enforcement wants program managers to register as Providers.
• If a bankʼs program manager registers: is that an acknowledgment
that the bank is NOT in control?
• Latest input from one bank examiner (speaking unofficially): would
prefer registration for program managers so that both are regulated.

FinCEN Notice of Proposed Rule-Making : Cross border transportation Reporting

• Expands scope of cross-border reporting requirements
• Adds “tangible prepaid access device” to the list of other monetary
instruments that must be reported at the U.S. border >$10,000.
• “Tangible prepaid access device” is defined as “any physical item that
can be transported, mailed, or shipped into or out of the United States
and the use of which is dedicated to obtaining access to prepaid funds
or the value of funds by the possessor in any manner without regard to
whom the prepaid access is issued.”
• Includes (i) general use prepaid cards, (ii) payroll cards, (iii)
government benefits cards, and (iv) store gift cards, etc.
• Excludes (i) credit cards and debit cards, (ii) codes and PINs, and items
like computers or Web-enabled cell phones, or (iii) other devices that
are not dedicated to accessing specific prepaid funds.
• Also excludes cross-border transportation of prepaid cards by
businesses shipping inventory to sales agents

Durbin Amendment: 3 Exemptions
(1) Exempt if the issuer together with its affiliates have assets
of less than $10 billion --- OR
(2) Exempt if it is a debit or prepaid card provided to a person
pursuant to a federal, state or local government
administered payment program where the holder can
ONLY access funds from such program.
But
Exclusion can be lost if “provisos” not met:
–

one year after the effective date a fee for an overdraft (including a fee
assessed for a shortage of funds or for a transaction processed for an
amount exceeding the account balance) may be charged; or a fee imposed
by the issuer for the first ATM withdrawal per month from an ATM that is part
of the issuer’s designated ATM network may be charged.

(3) AND a “general purpose reloadable card” exemption….

Durbin Amendment: The reloadable
general use prepaid card exemption
Exempt if it is a “reloadable general use prepaid card” that is
(i) Not issued or approved for use to access or debit any account held by or
for the benefit of the cardholder (other than a subaccount or other method
of recording or tracking funds purchased or loaded on the card on a prepaid
basis)
(ii) Reloadable and not marketed or labeled as a gift card or gift certificate; and
(iii) The card is the only means of access to the underlying funds, except
when all remaining funds are provided to the cardholder in a single
transaction.” Restricts convenience checks, bill pay or remittance via ACH,
“because certain reloadable prepaid cards are virtually identical in function to
debit cards”

Same additional “provisos” apply as with government administered cards:
no overdraft fees; 1 free ATM transaction each month.

Durbin Amendment Update: The
reloadable general use prepaid card
exemption
•

September 9: Fed issued “Frequently Asked Questions about GeneralUse Prepaid Cards and Circumvention and Evasion” (FAQs).
– Some helpful insights – such as “convenience checks payable to the
cardholder” do not violate “sole means of access” obligation.
– But “sole means of access” still stands - bill-pay and FSA restrictions
still a concern.

•
•
•

Still talk of Congressional or even legislative action regarding the new
“sole means of access” requirement.
Was effective October 1st
Banks must self-certify to Visa and MasterCard regarding eligibility for the
exemption.

Prices NOT lower. Electronic Payment Coalition Survey shows “no
consumer benefit” from lowered “swipe fees”. http://bit.ly/wAeQb8 However, merchants learn that cost of accepting debit and prepaid has
INCREASED for small dollar transactions. http://aol.it/tGbOv8
– WSJ: Visa & MasterCard have eliminated discounts on small
transactions
– Coffee shops estimate a 35% increase in interchange on
transactions less than $10
– Consumers now asked to pay with cash.

Routing and Exclusivity
Primary change: Two Unaffiliated networks per prepaid access
device with 4-party systems
Also: Prohibited exclusivity arrangements by networks.
•

A payment card network “may not restrict or otherwise limit an issuer‘s
ability to contract with any other payment card network that may process
an electronic debit transaction involving the issuer‘s debit cards.”
Voluntary exclusive arrangements - – Prohibited even if there is no contractual rule or restriction.

Non-reloadable Open Loop Gift Cards
• Difficulty: Only one signature network per card
– No PIN network, no addresses for sending PINs
– Board urged to exempt such cards entirely

•

Decision: No exemption. Instead, more time to figure it out

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)

•The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) is a
new Consumer Protection Agency for financial services.
•For the first time, there will be a federal regulator over both banks AND
certain non-bank financial institutions, such as payday lenders, checkcashers and mortgage brokers.
•The scope of CFPB powers is broad and includes selling, providing or
issuing “stored value.”
•Conventional Wisdom: CFPB would have power to regulate nonbanks ONLY after a “confirmed Director” is in place.
•Recess Appointment of Richard Cordray has raised questions: Was
Congress in recess? Was Cordray “confirmed” by the Senate? Does
it make a difference?
39

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)

Meetings with the CFPB re: Prepaid - •Yes, prepaid is on their radar screens
•Consumer groups are urging more regulation
•CFPB regulators are actively purchasing and using
prepaid cards in order to understand the products
better
•Prepaid is not their first priority – which are:
•Mortgage brokering and servicing
•Payday lending
•Private student lending
•But it is still a priority
•Collecting data from industry, consumers and
consumer groups.

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)

Reasons for heightened
concern.
• CFPB empowered to prohibit a covered person or service
provider from committing or engaging in an unfair, deceptive or
abusive act or practice.
• “Abusive” is a new and generally untested legal standard
• CFPB collects data (such as complaints) or does research.
• Three critical powers
– Examination of covered entities
– Rulemaking
– Enforcement

• Mission: To make markets for consumer financial services
“work for America.” See www.cfpb.gov
43

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)

Lessons from Payday Lenders
Lessons from the payday lending industry:
– “Field Hearings” in Birmingham, AL (with little advance notice) –
inviting comments from public, industry and community leaders
– More Field Hearings expected – perhaps on a monthly basis
– Requests for data from industry
– Expecting proposed regulations and active investigations
"We will begin dealing face-to-face with payday lenders,
mortgage servicers, mortgage originators, private student
lenders, and other firms that often compete with banks but
have largely escaped any meaningful federal oversight,"
Cordray said

“Abusive”

2/13/12

– How UDAP becomes UDAAP…

• UDAP: unfair or deceptive acts or practices
– There must be a representation, omission, or practice that is likely to
mislead.
– The act or practice must be considered from the perspective of the
reasonable consumer.
– The representation, omission, or practice must be a material one.

• UDAAP: unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices.
Abusive: materially interferes with the ability of a consumer
to understand a term or condition or takes unreasonable
advantage of:
– A lack of understanding on the part of the consumer of the material risks,
costs, or conditions
– The inability of the consumer to protect his or her own interests
– The reasonable reliance by the consumer on a covered person to act in the
interests of the consumer.
45

45

The additional “abusive” standard…
• “Amorphous” and “Subjective”
• Can be “technically legal” but still “abusive.”
• Exam Manual – Indicators of Problems:
–
–
–
–
–
–
–

Is profitability dependent on penalty fees?
Terms subject to change at discretion at any time?
Is there a high rate of fees that are routinely “reversed”?
Does the pricing structure make total costs hard to understand?
Is there a penalty to terminate the product with loss of benefits?
Is there a fee or cost just to access balances or consumer data?
Is the product targeted to higher risk populations, such as:
• Students, Elderly, Minority populations
• Low income, on public assistance, low credit scores

The CFPB & Emerging Payments
• CFPB has begun examinations of banks with more than $10
billion in assets and has also begun requesting data
regarding prepaid card programs.
• Examiners are (i) assessing the inherent risks of the payment
products and (ii) reviewing what is being done to mitigate
those risks.
• Prepaid card issuers and marketers may wish to use the
Exam manual to have a risk assessment performed of their
products – for each step of the productsʼ life cycle.
• Anticipate scrutiny of complaints – focus on resolving
recurring consumer problems asap.

Itʼs going to happen. Be ready.

Dodd-Frank & Remittances
Dodd-Frank Act Section 1073
• "Remittance transfer" is an "electronic ... transfer of funds requested by a
sender located in any State to a designated recipient [in a foreign
country] that is initiated by a remittance transfer provider ..."
• EXCLUSION: Small-value transactions, less than $15.
• “Remittance transfer provider” is “any person or financial institution
that provides remittance transfers for a consumer in the normal
course of its business, whether or not the consumer holds an
account with such person or financial institution.”
• Applies to remittances to foreign countries requested by a consumer and
initiated by a remittance transfer provider.
• Regulates Disclosures for sender and recipients; error resolution.

A word about Money
Transmitter Licensing laws
• Genesis: “Safety and soundness” of non-bank –issuers (Banks are
generally exempt)
• Regulates non-bank entities that receive and hold consumer funds, with
promise of making funds available later – or sending funds elsewhere.
• Money Order and Travelers Cheque issuers; Remittance companies
• 48 states have enacted such laws, which usually require:
–
–
–
–
–

Minimum capitalization ($50,000-$1 million) and bonding
Background checks on principals
Holding of 100% consumer funds in “permissible investments”
Regular reports; annual renewal filings; fees; audits
No restrictions on other lines of business – thousands are licensed

• Difficult to get but still a “poor manʼs bank license”
51

A word about Money
Transmitter Licensing laws
• “Disintermediation” of banks...
– Paypal , Google, American Express

• But even worse – state banks at a disadvantage
– Uniform Money Services Agreement – NCCUSL
– Exempt only “if it does not issue, sell, or provide payment instruments
or stored value through an authorized delegate who is not a bank.”
• 9 States: Alaska, Arkansas, Idaho, Maine, New Jersey, North Dakota,
Vermont, Washington, Wyoming

– Exempts banks only if it is a national bank or a state bank chartered or
authorized to do business in their OWN state; out of state, state banks
not exempt:
• Alabama, Colorado, Mississippi, Nevada, Oregon, Utah

Cost – at least 2 years and $250,000
Ongoing compliance, renewals, fees - At least one full-time licensing employee
And a full time AML Compliance officer
Risks - - – Doing money transmission business without a license – federal
crime 18 USC § 1960
– States increasingly penalizing non-banks $10-$100,000
– Subject to audit and supervision
These laws allow Western Union, Moneygram, Paypal, and Google to
do payments business without a banking partner.

– Liability may remain with the bank, even if funds transferred

(4) Compliance obligations – AML; CARD act and consumer
protection; Class action risks; privacy and data security
(5) Third party risks – lack of controls
– Bank has contract with cardholders – ultimate obligor
– Bank must control terms, pricing, features
– Regulators scrutinize closely

Electronic and Prepaid
Payments are Growing….
From the Federal Reserve 2010 Payments study…

• While prepaid cards had the lowest transaction volume of all noncash
payments at 6 billion, these transactions represented the fastest
growing payment type, increasing 21.5 percent annually from 2006 to
2009
• 20 billion more electronic payments were made in 2009 than in 2006,
which represented a 9.3 percent annual increase and accounted for
close to 80 percent of noncash payments.
• Yet, with 27.5 billion checks still being written, almost half of which
are consumer-to-business transactions, much opportunity lies ahead.

63

Prepaid Cards Provide Solutions to Consumers—
Center for Financial Service Innovation (CFSI)
• “Our findings give evidence about the potential of prepaid cards to
enhance familiesʼ financial well-being.”
• “Interviewees saw the cards as a useful tool, a way to escape the
high fees imposed by banks and check-cashing companies”
• “Most customers felt the costs associated with prepaid are fair and
lower than what they would incur if they used a check casher or
checking account.”

INSTITUTE OF CONTINUING LEGAL EDUCATION IN GEORGIA

BOARD OF TRUSTEES
The State Bar of Georgia and the Law Schools of The University of Georgia, Emory
University and Mercer University established the Institute of Continuing Legal
Education in Georgia in August 1965. In 1984, Georgia State University College of
Law was added to the consortium, and in 2005, John Marshall Law School was
added. The purpose of the Institute is to provide an outstanding continuing legal
education program so that members of the legal profession are afforded a means of
enhancing their skills and keeping abreast of developments of the law. The Institute
is governed by a Board of Trustees composed of twenty-eight members consisting of
the Immediate Past President, the President, the President-elect, the Secretary, and
the Treasurer, all of the State Bar of Georgia; the President, President-elect and the
Immediate Past President of the Young Lawyers Division; nine members to be
appointed by the President of the State Bar of Georgia, each for a term of three years
(the President has three appointments each year); two representatives of each of the
participating law schools; and the Immediate Past Chairperson of the Institute. The
Immediate Past President of the State Bar of Georgia serves as Chairperson of the
Board of Trustees of the Institute.

GEORGIA MANDATORY CLE FACT SHEET
• Every “active” attorney in Georgia must attend 12 “approved” CLE hours of instruction
annually, with one of the CLE hours being in the area of legal ethics and one of the CLE
hours being in the area of professionalism. Furthermore, any attorney who appears as sole
or lead counsel in the Superior or State Courts of Georgia in any contested civil case or in
the trial of a criminal case in 1990 or in any subsequent calendar year, must complete for
such year a minimum of three hours of continuing legal education activity in the area of trial
practice. These trial practice hours are included in, and not in addition to, the 12 hour
requirement. ICLE is an “accredited” provider of “approved” CLE instruction.
• Excess creditable CLE hours (i.e., over 12) earned in one CY may be carried over into the
next succeeding CY. Excess ethics and professionalism credits may be carried over for two
years. Excess trial practice hours may be carried over for one year.
• A portion of your ICLE name tag is your ATTENDANCE CONFIRMATION which
indicates the program name, date, amount paid, CLE hours (including ethics, professionalism and trial practice, if any) and should be retained for your personal CLE and tax
records. DO NOT SEND THIS CARD TO THE COMMISSION!
• ICLE will electronically transmit computerized CLE attendance records directly into the
Official State Bar Membership computer records for recording on the attendee’s Bar record.
Attendees at ICLE programs need do nothing more as their attendance will be recorded
in their Bar record.
• The Commission on Continuing Lawyer Competency staff will mail a prescribed affidavit
form to each active attorney at the end of the year. The form will show the CLE courses
attended and the number of credit hours that are entered in the Bar records. Each attorney
will swear or affirm that the CLE credits claimed on the affidavit were ACTUALLY
ATTENDED. Attorneys who are late attending or have to leave a seminar for a period
of time will have to strike the CLE hours shown on the affidavit and enter the hours
actually attended and claimed; or inform the ICLE staff at the seminar to reduce the hours
in the ICLE records before transmitting the credit hours in the ICLE record!
• If the affidavit is correct, the member need only sign the form confirming actual attendance
and return it to the Commission.
• If the affidavit is incorrect, the member should enter the corrections, sign the form, and
return it to the Commission.
• Do not mail anything to the Commission other than the affidavit. No receipts or other
evidence of attendance are required to support the affidavit unless requested by the
Commission.
• Should you need CLE credit in a state other than Georgia, please inquire as to the procedure
at the registration desk. ICLE does not guarantee credit in any state other than Georgia.
• Any questions concerning attendance credit at ICLE seminars should be directed to Linda

TO:

ICLE Seminar Attendee

Thank you for attending this seminar. We hope that these program materials will provide
a great initial reference and resource for you in the particular subject matter area. There
is a chance, however, that you might find an error(s) in these materials, like a wrong case
citation or a typographical mistake that results in an obvious misstatement of blackletter law, such as an incorrect length for the applicable statute of limitations.
In an effort to make them as correct as possible, should you discover a significant
substantive error(s), please note it (them) on the Errata Sheet below. Then, please detach
the sheet and mail it to ICLE, P.O. Box 1885, Athens, GA 30603-1885 or fax it to (706)
369-5899. We will collect all the errata sheets and, after a reasonable time mail a
correction to all seminar attendees and those attorneys who have ordered the book.
Should you have a different legal interpretation or opinion from the author's, the
appropriate way to address this is by giving him or her a call, which by the very nature
of our seminars is always welcome.
Thank you for your help. It is truly appreciated.
